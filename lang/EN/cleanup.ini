DOC_CLEANUP_TOOLS=The website cleanup tools page will allow you to empty any website cache, as well as automatically locate and repair common problems, and remove any orphaned data. There are a number of cleanup tools, which are run individually; ideally none ever need to be used, but if things happen outside the norm (such as corruption, or bugs), they can be very useful.
CACHES=Caches
ORPHANED_UPLOADS=Find orphaned uploads
MISSING_CONTENT_LANG_STRINGS=Content language strings that were missing
MISSING_CONTENT_LANG_STRINGS_ZERO=Content language strings that were bound to zero
FUSED_CONTENT_LANG_STRINGS=Content language strings that were fused to multiple content items
ORPHANED_CONTENT_LANG_STRINGS=Content language strings that were orphaned (unused)
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_CONTENT_LANG_STRINGS=The website software has advanced internationalisation support at its core: most content can be naturally translated into multiple languages. This support requires all content language strings to be stored separately to actual content. This tool will detail and repair any problems in the link between content and content language strings.
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_UPLOADS=The website software associates on-disk files (stored in the <kbd>uploads/</kbd> subdirectories) with content. This tool will list all the files the website software believes are on-disk, but not actually used. Please do not delete them without giving each individual consideration: it is possible that someone has manually placed them (or a non-bundled addon has made them) and referenced them in a non-standard way.
ORPHANED_TAGS=Remove orphaned tags
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_TAGS=Remove any tags that have somehow ended up orphaned from any content.
LANGUAGE_CACHE=Language cache
DESCRIPTION_LANGUAGE_CACHE=The language cache caches strings for languages in a fast PHP-friendly format.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_lang_cache=Enable language caching. This will give a small performance improvement.
CLEANUP_TOOLS=Website cleanup tools
CLEANUP_PAGE_EXP_CACHES=De-cachers
CLEANUP_PAGE_CACHES=You may wish to rebuild caches after editing content outside the official website interfaces, or if cache files are lost or corrupt &ndash; however you should not ever need to rebuild caches if you have only been administering the website normally. <a href="#!" data-click-toggle-checked="{1}">Toggle all</a>.
CLEANUP_PAGE_EXP_OPTIMISERS=Optimisers
CLEANUP_PAGE_MISC_TOOLS=Choose what you would like to do from the list. It is advised to only tick (check) the options you need &ndash; indiscriminately running all tools will not likely result in any net benefit, and will cause a temporary load-increase on your server. Some additional tools are available inside the <a target="_blank" title="Upgrader (this link will open in a new window)" href="{1}">upgrader</a>.
DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATES_CACHE=Empty the templates cache (language, theme and site configuration information is compiled into the template cache).
IMAGE_THUMBS=Regenerate image thumbnails
DESCRIPTION_IMAGE_THUMBS=Erase all the thumbnails for your images.
COMCODE_CACHE=Comcode field pre-calculations
DESCRIPTION_COMCODE_CACHE=Comcode fields are cached in a precalculated format which is a cross between Comcode and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. In theory this should mean that changes to site configuration shouldn't damage the integrity, but some changes may do so.
SELF_LEARNING_CACHE=Self-learning cache
DESCRIPTION_SELF_LEARNING_CACHE=This smart cache learns what resources pages needed, in order to pre-load pinpointed resources in efficient batch operations.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_block_cache=Enable block caching. It is highly recommended that this option is left on for a production website, but while you are setting up a site you may wish to disable it so that your changes are reflected immediately.
DESCRIPTION_THEME_IMAGES_CACHE=Any mapping in the theme image mapping which is not a specially uploaded user-image. This will allow re-searching for URLs for theme images that have not been explicitly overridden in the image manager.
BLOCK_CACHE=Block/persistent/static cache
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comcode_page_cache=Enable Comcode page caching. It is highly recommended this option is left on for a production website, but while you are setting up a site you may wish to disable it so you can directly edit Comcode pages as text files on the server (in theory the software can track when you change the file manually, but sometimes dates can get confused between desktop machines and servers). Disabling this option will also stop the correct titles of parent pages showing in breadcrumbs.
COMCODE_PAGE_CACHE=Comcode page cache
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_template_cache=Enable template caching. If you are editing templates manually (without the aid of the website software) and do not want to manually empty the cache for every change, this option can be turned off (in theory the software can track when you change the file manually, but sometimes dates can get confused between desktop machines and servers).
TEMPLATE_CACHE=Template cache
DESCRIPTION_BLOCKS_CACHE=Purge the block caching, and also the persistent caching, and the static cache.
DISPOSABLE_VALUES_CACHE=Statistics cache
DESCRIPTION_DISPOSABLE_VALUES_CACHE=Certain statistics, such as total downloads and bandwidth usage are calculated on-the-fly, and/or regularly calculated. If these statistics have become inaccurate, you may wish to recalculate them.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_cleanup=Website cleanup tools
ARCHIVE_PAGE_BACKUPS=Archive page/file revisions
DESCRIPTION_ARCHIVE_PAGE_BACKUPS=Move all Comcode page revisions, CSS revisions, and template revisions, into <kbd>_old_backups</kbd> subdirectories.
HTTP_CACHE=HTTP cache
DESCRIPTION_HTTP_CACHE=Empty the HTTP cache (like "Temporary Internet Files" in a web browser).
META_TREE_REBUILD=Rebuild theme meta-tree
DESCRIPTION_META_TREE_REBUILD=Rebuild all the symlinks under the theme <kbd>_meta_dir</kbd> directories. These are used to make theme editing easier for power users working via direct file access. Symlinks are created to show all co-related templates, and screen template trees.
LOST_DISK_CONTENT=Sync for lost disk content
DESCRIPTION_LOST_DISK_CONTENT=Delete database records for Comcode pages and Zones that no longer exist on disk.
REBUILD_SITEMAP=Rebuild XML Sitemap
DESCRIPTION_REBUILD_SITEMAP=The XML Sitemap is built iteratively as content is added. It could become incorrect if permissions have changed, or some kind of bug has stopped it growing properly. This will force a rebuild from the software's full Sitemap generator.
URL_METADATA_CACHE=URL metadata cache
DESCRIPTION_URL_METADATA_CACHE=Empty URL existence and URL metadata caches.
TEMPLATE_USAGE=Template usage
DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE_USAGE=Delete stored metadata about what templates have been called, in relation to what other templates.
TEMP=Temp data
DESCRIPTION_TEMP=Delete all temp data, including in-progress CAPTCHAs, and in-progress file uploads. The associated directories and database tables should self-clean, so this tool should not normally be needed.
EMAIL_BOUNCES=E-mail bounces
DESCRIPTION_EMAIL_BOUNCES=Delete the record of which e-mail addresses have bounced. You would not normally want to empty this because allowing excessive bounces will harm your e-mail reputation.
DESCRIPTION_REORGANISE_UPLOADS=Reorganise your uploads to the optimal configured organisational scheme.

MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_broken_urls=Broken URL scanning
BROKEN_URLS=Broken URL scanning
DOC_BROKEN_URLS=This tool will find references to URLs or on-disk files that are not actually there (&ldquo;broken links&rdquo;).
URL_FIELDS=Database URL fields
CATALOGUE_FIELDS=Catalogue URL fields
MOZ_BACKLINKS=Backlinks (from Moz API)
GOOGLE_BROKEN_BACKLINKS__auth_permissions=Known permission-denied backlinks (from Google Search Console)
GOOGLE_BROKEN_BACKLINKS__not_found=Known not-found backlinks (from Google Search Console)
GOOGLE_BROKEN_BACKLINKS__server_error=Known server-error backlinks (from Google Search Console)
GOOGLE_BROKEN_BACKLINKS__soft404=Known soft-404 backlinks (from Google Search Console)
DESCRIPTION_LINK_TYPES=Select the link type(s) you want to enumerate then check.
TABLE_NAME=Table name
FIELD_NAME=Field name
SHOW_URL_PASSES=Show passes
DESCRIPTION_SHOW_URL_PASSES=Show all URLs, not only those that have failed checks.
FIND_URLS=Find URLs
PENDING_LINK_CHECK=The URLs below have been identified along with where they appear. We have not scanned them yet, click the &ldquo;Check URLs&rdquo; button at the bottom to do that. Alternatively if you prefer to use a third-party tool for checking URLs you could copy and paste them through to that tool from the table.
CHECK_URLS=Check URLs
LIVE_BASE_URLS=Live base URL(s)
DESCRIPTION_LIVE_BASE_URLS=The base URL(s) of the live site. Any URLs starting with this/these will be replaced with the base URL of this site, to check the URLs work on this site.
MAXIMUM_API_RESULTS=Maximum API results
DESCRIPTION_MAXIMUM_API_RESULTS=The maximum number of results to query out of APIs, where applicable. Some APIs only allow querying small numbers of results at a time, and have rate-limits, so querying out more results takes longer.
