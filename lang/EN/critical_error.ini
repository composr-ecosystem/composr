NO_PARAMETER_SENT=A critical parameter, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was missing.
NO_PARAMETER_SENT_SPECIAL=A critical parameter, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was missing. This error usually happens when the website engine has been installed with an incorrect base URL (such as http://example.com/ instead of http://www.example.com/). Some server configurations allow multiple domain names as illustrated, but perform automated redirections which result in parameter loss. If you are the site owner you may need to reconfigure your server or base URL.

A summary of the alerts follows:\n{3}\n\nManage IP bans from this screen:\n[url="{4}"]{4}[/url]
AUTO_BAN_DOS_MESSAGE=An IP address, {1}, has been automatically banned for generating {2} flood warnings in {3} seconds. If you believe that the user was manipulated into triggering the alerts, you may wish to consider unbanning this IP address. Be advised that the website software has essentially prevented what could be a 'DOS' (Denial Of Service) attack which could over-load the server if left to continue; it may have been triggered by innocent infected computers, or other form of computer manipulation. This said, this may just be an innocent computer that accidentally or for good reason, using up a high server load.
NO_SUCH_THEME_IMAGE=No such theme image, <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
PROBLEM_AJAX=There was a problem with an AJAX request:
NETWORK_DOWN=The network or website appears to be down, so an AJAX request has failed. You won't receive further warnings during this page view, but some actions may not work correctly until connectivity is restored.
HACK_ATTACK_INFO=A potential hacking attempt has been detected. Please do not be alarmed: approximately half of the suspected attempts are triggered innocently (the software intentionally has a paranoid security model, to give you very high security). Real hacking attempts are almost always caused by 'bots' (computer programs) that automatically crawl the Internet looking for websites which may contain vulnerabilities, and then reporting any found vulnerabilities to their 'master' for future exploitation (usually, to assist in spam relaying). If this was a real hack attempt, it has failed - you might want to try and analyse the logged details (in case it gives clues to a real and persistent offender). More information on security is given in the software documentation.
ERROR_MAIL=An error occurred at:\n[url="{1}"]{1}[/url]\nHappened to IP address: {3}.\n\nThe full error details follow:\n\n[html]{2}[/html]

SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_POSTED=You have gone to a URL which requires &lsquo;posted&rsquo; data to be sent (<kbd>{1}</kbd>), as well as the information in the URL itself. This is most likely because you have copied and pasted a link to a new browser window, but the page the link was for was a results page for an action.
SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_POSTED_FILE_ERROR=It appears that you have made a file upload but exceeded this servers &lsquo;post_max_size&rsquo; limit ({2}) or &lsquo;upload_max_filesize&rsquo; limit ({3}). This makes your form submission invisible to the software. Please try again with a smaller size, or get the <kbd>post_max_size</kbd> limit increased. An alternate explanation is if you reached this URL manually &ndash; this URL is intended solely for processing the result of a form submitted to it, and the <var>{1}</var> parameter is missing.
WRITE_ERROR=Cannot write to <kbd>{1}</kbd>. File permissions for it (or the directory it is in) may have not been set correctly.
READ_ERROR=Cannot read the <kbd>{1}</kbd> file. It is probably missing.

STACK_TRACE_INFORMATION=Below is a stack trace revealing the state the software was in when the error occurred. If this represents a bug in the unmodified software, you may want to check {1} website for a fix, and if there isn't one, report this as a bug. Please note that merely posting a stack trace is not sufficient for us to solve your problem; the stack trace is just an aid that presents us with additional information. We still need to know the error message, what you tried to do, how you tried to do it, version numbers, and any other appropriate information.<br />We apologise for this problem and if it's a bug we hope you will work with us so that we can fix it for you promptly.

BAD_ACCESS_DOMAIN=You are accessing via <kbd>{2}</kbd>, but the domain in the base URL is <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Accessing from the wrong domain will cause <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> problems, and JavaScript security errors. You might want to set up a redirect on your web server to guarantee visitors reach the correct domain.
BROKEN_XHTML_FIXED=<p class="red-alert" role="error">This code may have contained non-conformant XHTML. Some display changes were made to avoid crashing this editor.</p>
COOKIE_CONFLICT_DELETE_COOKIES=You have conflicting cookies on your computer. The website can not set cookies as others are stuck in place. Please delete all cookies for this website in your web browser.

WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE_2=You have permission to <form class="inline" method="post" action="{1}">{2}<div class="inline"><button type="submit" class="button-hyperlink">see a stack trace</button></div></form>. This error message probably does not indicate a system fault, which is why the stack trace was not shown automatically; however if it is a fault, stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem and thus are great for bug reports. As the page is POSTed clicking the link will resubmit the form.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE_3=You have permission to <a href="{1}">see a stack trace</a>. This error message probably does not indicate a system fault, which is why the stack trace was not shown automatically; however if it is a fault, stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem and thus are great for bug reports. You uploaded some files which we can't resend automatically, so the link will take you back to the front page, but if you then go forward to repeat the action you will see a stack trace instead.
NO_PHP_IN_TEMPLATES=The hidden <kbd>allow_php_in_templates</kbd> option is not turned on, so PHP code in templates will not run. The option is described in the Composr Code Book, available from compo.sr. The standard practice for your use case is to create and reference a miniblock, as it separates concerns well, promotes re-usability, and provides a security barrier.
HTACCESS_SEO_PROBLEM=It looks like you have enabled an advanced URL Scheme option and added a custom zone, but may not have edited your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file to refer to the new zone by extending the default rewrite-rules.
NO_INTEGERS_TEMPLATE=Programming error: Integers and/or floats should not be passed into templates (<var>{1}</var>): convert them to strings via <kbd>integer_format</kbd>/<kbd>float_format</kbd>/<kbd>strval</kbd>.
TOO_MANY_USERS_ONLINE=There are too many online users to list.
CANNOT_WILDCARD_START=There are too many users to search like this, please put your wildcard further in the query.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__TOP_ONLY=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the most significant {1} {1|one|ones} here.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__RECENT_ONLY=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the most recent {1} {1|one|ones} here. You can access edit screens from the main website screens (which have paginated results) or the search module.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__ALPHABETICAL=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the first {1} {1|one|ones} here (alphabetically). You can access edit screens from the main website screens (which have paginated results) or the search module.
MAYBE_NOT_FATAL=You have turned on stack traces for all errors, via having <kbd>keep_fatalistic=1</kbd> in the URL. This means that this may not actually be a fatal error, you have just asked for it to be presented as such (perhaps to help you find where it came from).
FILE_IN_ARCHIVE_TWICE=Cannot add {1} to the archive twice. Archives need to be completely rebuilt to replace a file.
CACHE_NOT_READY_YET=This information has not loaded yet. It will be generated in the background, please come back later.

ERRORS=Errors
STOPPED_BY_ANTISPAM=Your action has been blocked by our antispam system ({2}). You may have been blocked because your IP address ({1}) was on an external ban list which was checked by us. Or, you may have been blocked by our internal antispam heuristics. If you are a genuine user, please run a virus scan, secure your network, and try again in a few days. If you are using a proxy, VPN, or Tor, consider disabling it or changing regions. Please do not try repeating your action again too soon or too frequently or you could end up getting banned.
IP_BAN_LOG_AUTOBAN_ANTISPAM=Auto-blocked by remote spam list checks ({1})
ERROR_CHECKING_FOR_SPAMMERS=Could not run spam check using the [tt]{1}[/tt] service. The error message returned was: {2}. The action has been let through without a check. The IP involved was [tt]{3}[/tt].
ERROR_CHECKING_FOR_SPAMMERS_RBL_IS_NORMAL_DNS=Could not run spam check using the [tt]{1}[/tt] service. This is a normal Domain Name Service instead of an actual RBL. Try changing the RBL configuration to use the IP address [tt]{2}[/tt]. The action has been let through without a check. The IP involved was [tt]{3}[/tt].
NOTIFICATION_TYPE_spam_check_block=Perceived spammer blocked
NOTIFICATION_SPAM_CHECK_BLOCK_SUBJECT_BAN=Perceived spammer banned ({1})

SPAM_REPORT_TRIGGERED_SPAM_HEURISTICS=Multiple triggers to spam heuristics (such as blackholes, or splatter-gun link injection)
SPAM_REPORT_SITE_FLOODING=Flooding POST requests
SPAM_REPORT_NO_EMAIL_OR_USERNAME=We can't report this user because either there was no known username, or no known e-mail address. Stop Forum Spam requires full details.
TEMPCODE_NOT_ARRAY=Tempcode error: Not an array!
WORDFILTER_YOU=The word filter has detected a banned word (&lsquo;{1}&rsquo;) and has halted your submission.
NO_SELECTABLE_THEME_IMAGES_MSN=You are running from a multi-site-network satellite which means you need to select an existing theme image for this resource (as uploads would not go to the central site), rather than uploading one. However all theme images from the {1} set seem to be missing.
SUHOSIN_MAX_VALUE_TOO_SHORT=The PHP Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small. This will stop this form from saving.
SUHOSIN_MAX_VARS_TOO_LOW=The PHP/Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small. This may stop this form from saving.
_SUHOSIN_MAX_VARS_TOO_LOW=The PHP/Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small. This has stopped this form from saving.
__SUHOSIN_MAX_VARS_TOO_LOW=The PHP/Suhosin extension is configured with a [tt]{1}[/tt] setting that is too small.
NOT_ON_GOOGLE_APPENGINE=This function is not available on Google App Engine. Where applicable, use an alternative App Engine-specific process.
NOT_ON_LIVE_GOOGLE_APPENGINE=This function is not available on the live Google App Engine application. Perform the action on the development site, and then redeploy (for more details see the Installing on Google App Engine tutorial).
IMAP_NEEDED=This functionality requires the PHP <abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr> extension.
IMAP_ERROR=<abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr> error: {1}
DOUBLE_SUBMISSION_PREVENTED=This submission has been blocked because it conflicts with another very similar submission you made within the last {1}.<br /><br />Perhaps you accidentally clicked the button twice, or refreshed this page in your browser.<br /><br />If we have made a mistake, and you really did intend two very similar submissions, wait {2} then refresh this page.
OLD_GD_ON_SERVER=The PHP GD extension on the server is too old.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP GD extension on the server (no PHP graphics functionality), which is required.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER_PNG=PHP does not have PNG support built-into the GD library, which is required. This is very unusual. If you have made a custom PHP build you should install the PNG library and rebuild.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER_JPEG=PHP does not have JPEG support built-into the GD library, which is required. This is very unusual. If you have made a custom PHP build you should install the PNG library and rebuild.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER_TTF=PHP does not have TTF support built-into the GD library, which is required. If you have made a custom PHP build you should install the FreeType2 library and rebuild. If you are using a third-party PHP build with unusual settings (such as those on Mac OS), you should install an official PHP build.
NO_EXIF_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP EXIF availability on the server (the PHP EXIF extension is not available). This means the software cannot work with the metadata inside JPEG files.
NO_POSIX_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP POSIX availability on the server (the PHP POSIX extension is not available). This means the software cannot properly verify file permissions.
NO_CTYPE_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP ctype availability on the server (the PHP ctype extension is not available). This has a slight performance impact.
NO_INTL_ON_SERVER=The PHP intl extension is not available. This means a number of internationalisation features will not be available.
NO_ZLIB_ON_SERVER=The PHP zlib extension is not available. This means various forms of compression will not be available.
NO_JSON_ON_SERVER=The PHP json extension is not available. This is required for basic functionality, and available by default, but some Linux distributions do not provide it for historic licensing reasons.
NO_HASH_ON_SERVER=The PHP hash extension is not available. This is recommended for security.
NO_XML_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP XML availability on the server (the PHP XML extension is not available). This means certain functionality, such as the displaying of [acronym="Really Simple Syndication"]RSS[/acronym] and Atom feeds, will not be able to function. XML support is considered required.
NO_CURL_ON_SERVER=The PHP cURL extension is not available. This means that server-to-server connections may not work completely reliably. cURL support is considered required.
MYSQL_TOO_OLD=You are using a very old version of MySQL ({2}). Composr requires version {1} or higher.
MYSQL_TOO_NEW=MySQL versions newer than {1}
MARIADB_TOO_OLD=You are using a very old version of MariaDB ({2}). Composr requires version {1} or higher.
MARIADB_TOO_NEW=MariaDB versions newer than {1}
MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET_TOO_LOW=The MySQL max_allowed_packet setting must be at least {1} bytes. it is currently {2} bytes.
APACHE_TOO_OLD=You are using a very old version of Apache ({2}). Composr requires version {1} or higher.
APACHE_TOO_NEW=Apache versions newer than {1}
LOW_MEMORY_LIMIT=Your server has a very low PHP memory limit, and the developers cannot guarantee that Composr will be able to function within this limit. Once you have installed the [tt].user.ini[/tt] file may override this but it may not work on all webhosts. If you cannot override or change the limit, consult your webhost; Composr may function to some degree, but problems will occur in numerous areas if more than a little content is added.
MODSECURITY=You appear to have ModSecurity (or a similar web application firewall) that is blocking some legitimate software requests with a status code of '{1}'. Web application firewalls are legitimate tools but are designed to be configured by expert programmers; unfortunately many webhosts deploy them indiscriminately. We will try and work around the issue on any key screens that are likely to cause false positives but we cannot guarantee this will work perfectly.
MISSING_UTF_SUPPORT=Neither the [tt]iconv[/tt] nor [tt]mbstring[/tt] PHP extensions are available. This may lead to some bugs processing non-English text.
NO_ZIP_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP ZIP extension on the server. Batch importing from ZIP files (this is not a common activity) will not work until ZIP support is enabled/configured (either via the extension, or via configuring Composr to use the InfoZip alternative).
WARNING_SSL=You are using HTTP rather than HTTPS. It is recommended to build new websites using HTTPS because web browsers give security-warnings on non-HTTPS websites. For this to work you will need to install a signed SSL certificate on your webhosting.
WARNING_SERVER_SOFTWARE=You are using server software that is not officially supported ({1}). URL Schemes redirects will need to be programmed by you, if you intend to use a URL Scheme.
WARNING_NON_MAINTAINED=Support for {1} is <a target="_blank" title="Non-maintained status (this link will open in a new window)" href="{2}/maintenance-status.htm#feature-{3}">not-actively-maintained</a>.
WARNING_SUEXEC=You do not appear to be using suEXEC (or similar), meaning the software web requests are running as a different user to the software file ownerships. You will need to manually chmod large numbers of files and directories and zone and addon management will be complicated. The software does not currently provide official support for this as it is <a target="_blank" title="Non-maintained status (this link will open in a new window)" href="{1}/maintenance-status.htm#feature-{2}">non-maintained</a>.
WARNING_OPEN_BASEDIR=Your server appears to have poorly configured security, as the software was able to identify other user's home directories on the server.
WARNING_ISSUE_WITH_ALWAYS_POPULATE_RAW_POST_DATA=The PHP [tt]always_populate_raw_post_data[/tt] setting should be set to [tt]-1[/tt], otherwise PHP errors may show that the software cannot suppress.
WARNING_DISK_SPACE=You have less than {1} of disk space remaining.
WARNING_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=Your server is configured to give only a few seconds for the slowest pages to load. This is a cause for concern.
PHP_TOO_OLD=PHP version {1} or newer is required
PHP_TOO_NEW=PHP versions newer than {1}
WARNING_MBSTRING_FUNC_OVERLOAD=The PHP [tt]mbstring.func_overload[/tt] setting is not set to [tt]0[/tt]. This PHP setting is explicitly advised against in the PHP manual and will cause numerous unexpected behaviours inside Composr and other scripts, so needs to be disabled. Unicode works in Composr without this option.
DISABLED_FUNCTION=An important PHP function, [tt]{1}[/tt], has been intentionally disabled on this web server. This essentially means the PHP language isn't fully available on this server &ndash; you may not be able to use Composr on it, depending on how the specific function is used.
NONPRESENT_EXTENSION_FUNCTION=An important PHP function, [tt]{1}[/tt], is not available, likely due to a required PHP extension being missing.
NO_UPLOAD=PHP must have file uploading enabled
ADBLOCKER=The preview frame seems to be missing. This is probably due to running a browser adblocker plugin.
INTERFERING_AD_SCRIPT=Your HTTP requests to PHP are being interfered with. Perhaps you are on free hosting where adverts get automatically injected into all PHP output. This lack of basic integrity will randomly break many features, particularly AJAX functionality.
JSON_ONLY=Only supported output type is JSON.
CHANGE_ERROR_HANDLING_SETTINGS=Change error handling settings
INCORRECT_COOKIE_DOMAIN=Incorrect cookie domain of <kbd>{1}</kbd> specified in the website's installation options (access domain is <kbd>{2}</kbd>). Cookies will not be able to save.
INCORRECT_COOKIE_PATH=Incorrect cookie path of <kbd>{1}</kbd> specified in the website's installation options (access path is <kbd>{2}</kbd>). Cookies will not be able to save.
UNKNOWN_CSS_MODE=Unknown CSS mode &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;.
CORRUPT_CSS_MODE=Invalid CSS mode definition for &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;.
DO_NOT_USE_INLINE_SCRIPT_TAGS=<kbd>{1}</kbd>: Do not use the inline script tags as they violate Content Security Policy restrictions and make it easier for hackers to steal user credentials.
CANNOT_COPY_TO_SERVER=An error occurred while trying to copy the file to the server
NO_DATA_IMPORTED=No data imported
FORUM_BASE_URL_UNCHANGED=You have not changed the forum base URL. If this URL is incorrect, aspects of your system will malfunction. Are you sure you wish to proceed?
FORUM_BASE_URL_INVALID=You may not install Composr into the same directory as your forum.
PASSWORDS_DO_NOT_MATCH=The given {1} passwords do not match
PASSWORDS_DO_NOT_REUSE=It is important that you do not re-use the database password for the {1} password, as the database password has to be stored as plain-text.
PASSWORD_INSECURE=Are you sure you want such an insecure {1} password? This will leave your installation and webhosting wide open to attack. You should use at least 12 characters and a combination of lower case, upper case, digits, and punctuation symbols.
FILENAME_TOO_LONG=The given filename is too long. When we encode the local relative URL to where file is saved to its disk directory, that URL must be less than 256 characters long.
TAG_CANNOT_BE_VISUALLY_EDITED=The <kbd>{1}</kbd> tag cannot edited via the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> tag editor.
FTP_CACHE_ERROR=There was an error setting file permissions via FTP on {1}. You may need to disable filesystem cache on your FTP server if it is enabled (for example, for proFTPd servers, add <kbd>FSCachePolicy Off</kbd> in the main conf file).
ALREADY_SUBMITTED_CONTENT=You may not make more than one submission and have already made a submission.
MISSING_PUBLIC_KEY=The public key for this version of the software (<kbd>data/keys/telemetry.pub</kbd>) is missing.
CORRUPT_PUBLIC_KEY=The public key for this version of the software (<kbd>data/keys/telemetry.pub</kbd>) is corrupt. Please replace with the original public key for this version.
MISSING_PRIVATE_KEY=The private key for version {1} of the software (<kbd>data_custom/keys/telemetry-{1}.key</kbd>) is missing.
CORRUPT_PRIVATE_KEY=The private key for version {1} of the software (<kbd>data_custom/keys/telemetry-{1}.key</kbd>) is corrupt.
_MISSING_PUBLIC_KEY=The public key for version {1} of the software (<kbd>data_custom/keys/telemetry-{1}.pub</kbd>) is missing.
_CORRUPT_PUBLIC_KEY=The public key for version {1} of the software (<kbd>data_custom/keys/telemetry-{1}.pub</kbd>) is corrupt.
INVALID_TELEMETRY_DATA=Invalid telemetry data passed for decryption.

HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM=A problem has been detected with your web server (HTTP code of &ldquo;{3}&rdquo;) that may cause your forms to fail. Some servers are poorly configured, and invisibly redirect traffic from one URL to another, and this invisible redirection results in lost submitted form data. Try changing your base URL{1} so that it {2}.
_WITH_WWW=doesn't contain &ldquo;<kbd>www.</kbd>&rdquo;
_WITHOUT_WWW=contains &ldquo;<kbd>www.</kbd>&rdquo;
_HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM_RUNNING= in the [url="config editor"]{1}[/url]
_HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM_INSTALLING=
IP_FORWARDING_CHANGE=Your server is failing to connect to itself through it's base URL, with an error code of &ldquo;{3}&rdquo;. {1} the &ldquo;{2}&rdquo; option. There can be other causes, such as your server blocking web requests to itself. If problems persist, contact your webhost.
_IP_FORWARDING_ENABLED=Try unsetting
_IP_FORWARDING_DISABLED=Try setting
_IP_FORWARDING_INSTALLING=After installing try setting
DB_META_CORRUPT_MISSING=The file &ldquo;/data/db_meta.bin&rdquo; is either missing or corrupt.
