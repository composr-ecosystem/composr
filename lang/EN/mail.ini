UNSUBSCRIBE_FORM_TEXT=<p>You are unsubscribing from automated e-mails and newsletters sent from <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Please provide your e-mail address. By doing so, it will be stored (in a hashed format) in accordance with our <a href="{2}">Privacy Policy</a> so that our mailing system knows it should never e-mail you. Because it will be hashed, it will be nearly impossible for anyone including staff to figure out what it was.</p><p>Note that this only stops e-mails sent through our website software. It is possible that staff or site members can still e-mail you directly. Also, if staff use a separate service to send out e-mails, that said service might still send you e-mails. You should <a href="mailto:{3}">contact the staff directly</a> to be removed from those as well if necessary.</p><p>To discourage abuse, your IP address will be logged, and the e-mail address you provide will receive one final e-mail indicating they were unsubscribed.</p>
