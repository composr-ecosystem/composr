[strings]
PASSWORD_RESET_PROCESS=Password reset process
CONFIG_OPTION_password_reset_process=All methods involved an e-mailed reset code. Set this to &ldquo;Temporary password&rdquo; if password resets should result in a temporary password (i.e. user must immediately choose a new password). Set this to &ldquo;E-mailed&rdquo; if a new password should be randomly generated and sent in another e-mail after the auth code check has passed (less secure). &ldquo;Ultra-secure&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;Temporary password&rdquo; except that the e-mailed reset code is sent in an extremely basic format, to make it harder to see what website it might relate to; it requires your server supports raw PHP e-mail and it bypasses the e-mail queue.
