TASKS_BACKGROUND=Use a task queue
CONFIG_OPTION_tasks_background=Some tasks in the software are resource intensive. They may cause dangerous server resource spikes, or they may cause time-outs or errors when run as normal web requests. When enabled, resource intensive tasks will be put into a queue to be gradually executed by the system scheduler (if it is not running, the task queue will fall back to executing immediately instead). The member will receive a notification when the task is complete. The task queue also has graceful error-handling. It is strongly recommended to leave this enabled unless you have a particularly powerful dedicated / Cloud server.
NOTIFICATION_TYPE_task_completed=Results of your background tasks

TOO_MANY_TASKS=<em>There are too many tasks in the queue to list them all.</em>
TASK_QUEUE_BACKED_UP=We are currently experiencing a large volume of tasks in the queue. Expect delays. We appreciate your patience.
