[strings]
DOC_ERRORLOG=Low-level logging provides a number of features to see what is happening under-the-hood.\n\nThe error log displays errors which have occurred on your site. It does not include errors relating to the normal running of your website (for example, incorrectly filled forms, or issues with non-configured features). The error log is useful for making sure problems are not left unfixed, and helping you report bugs to the developers; although the developers also recommend you enable error notifications so you are automatically notified of problems.\n\nLow-level logging also includes other logs that need to be manually enabled. You probably shouldn't leave the other logs enabled outside of debugging a problem, as they may eat up disk space quickly.\n\nFinally, a system scheduler reporting and management system is provided.
