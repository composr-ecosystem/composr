[strings]
DOC_ERRORLOG=Low-level logging provides a number of features to see what is happening under-the-hood.\n\nThe error log displays errors which have occurred on your site. It does not include errors relating to the normal running of your website (for example, incorrectly filled forms, or issues with non-configured features). The error log is useful for making sure problems are not left unfixed, and helping you report bugs to the developers; although the developers also recommend you enable error notifications so you are automatically notified of problems.\n\nLow-level logging also includes other logs that need to be manually enabled. You probably shouldn't leave the other logs enabled outside of debugging a problem, as they may eat up disk space quickly.
DOC_CRON_HOOKS=System scheduler hooks provides an interface for managing and monitoring tasks in the system scheduler (executed via the Cron file at [b]data/cron_bridge.php[/b]). \n\nFor each task, you can view the number of operations in the queue, the amount of time between runs, the last time it ran, how long it took, errors encountered, and whether or not it is enabled. You can also enable / disable or run on-demand individual tasks.

LOCKED_HOOKS=You have one or more locked hooks. Either they are taking a long time, or they bailed on an error (in which case they are restricted from running more than once per day until they succeed). Please review any errors encountered.
