DOC_SECURITY_LOG=The software monitors all web requests for potential security violations and thoroughly logs all suspicious activity. In addition, failed logins are logged, so that you can see if users are trying to illicitly access the accounts of members.\n\nYou can configure the behaviour of how different events are logged and treated, and how much risk score is assigned, through the [tt]Configure advanced banning[/tt] feature.
SECURITY_LOG=Security logging
FAILED_LOGINS=Failed logins
SECURITY_ALERTS=Security alerts
VIEW_ALERT=View security alert ({1})
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_types=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which may be uploaded by users. Leave blank if you want to just apply core security restrictions, and nothing further.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_images=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid images for inline display. Note that adding new file types won't necessarily work for all situations because PHP's GD library may need to support them (thumbnail generation), and the web browser may need to know how to display them using a normal <kbd>img</kbd> element. Additionally only images recognised in the software's hard-coded list of mime types will work.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_videos=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid videos for inline display. Note that adding new file types won't necessarily work because the software's media API may not have a handler for them, might not have defined mime-types for them, or web browser's may not all support them. Note that the software defines &ldquo;video&rdquo; <em>very</em> broadly, including some document formats.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_audios=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid audio files for inline playback. Note that adding new file types won't necessarily work because the software's media API may not have a handler for them, might not have defined mime-types for them, or web browser's may not all support them.
SECURITY_PAGE_CLEANUP=You may tick-off (check-off) alerts that you wish to delete. While deleting them does not actually remove them from the database, they will not show up on the interface anymore, and their risk score will not be factored against the IP address anymore. You should generally only do this for false-positive records.
POST_DATA_EXPLANATION=Any web request can be classified as either a &lsquo;GET&rsquo; request or a &lsquo;POST&rsquo; request. &lsquo;GET&rsquo; requests are carried out purely via a URL, while &lsquo;POST&rsquo; requests include additional data. The following data was posted when the security alert was raised&hellip;
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_security=Security logging
HACKER_DETECTED=Hacker/evil-bot: {1}
RISK=Risk score
DESCRIPTION_PRIVACY_SECURITY_LOG=Handle data pertaining to security logs (hack attacks triggered by you, content submission bans, IP address bans, and whitelisted IP addresses). IP and submission bans cannot be purged except by staff.
STANDING_RESTRICTIONS_SUBMIT_BAN=You are currently restricted from submitting any content to the site. Submission bans are serious, which means you may be at a high risk of a permanent ban if you violate any of the rules (Terms of Service) again.
