UPGRADER_UPGRADER_TITLE=The software upgrader
UPGRADER_UPGRADER_INTRO=This is the software upgrade tool. This tool is a part of the software, but it is intentionally kept lightweight to keep it working even if the software is partly broken (unlike the full <a title="Admin Zone (this link will open in a new window)" href="adminzone/" target="_blank">Admin Zone</a>).
UPGRADER_LOGIN_INFO=Once you log in you will be presented with some options to help you upgrade, apply a hotfix, or perform maintenance on your website.
UPGRADER_LOGIN_INFO_PASS_FORGET=If so, find the <kbd>maintenance_password</kbd> line of your <kbd>_config.php</kbd> file and put in a new temporary password (the one written there won't work because it is encrypted). Once you have done this you should promptly use the <kbd>config_editor.php</kbd> script to change the password, as this will save it again as encrypted.
UPGRADER_LOGIN_FORGOT_PASSWORD_Q=Forgot your password?
UPGRADER_CHOICES=The following choices are available to you:
UPGRADER_FTP_INFO=<p>If you need to do a file extraction or permission-fixing, then you'll probably need to enter <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> details below. If you don't need to do these, then blank out the fields (otherwise the upgrader will try to connect and fail if the details are incorrect).</p>
UPGRADER_UP_INFO_1=The the software database is up to date and does not require upgrading at this time (the version timestamp is <strong>{1}</strong>).
UPGRADER_CLOSENESS=<span>(The website is currently </span><em>{1}</em><span>)</span>
UPGRADER_UP_INFO_2=The the software database is <strong>not</strong> up to date and should be upgraded.<br />(The on-disk version timestamp is <strong>{1}</strong> and the in-database version timestamp is <strong>{2}</strong>.)<br />(Scheduled tasks are disabled until the upgrade is performed to prevent problems.)
UPGRADER_CLOSED_FOR_UPGRADES={1} will be closed for a brief time while upgrades are performed. We expect to be back shortly.
UPGRADER_MAINTENANCE=Maintenance
UPGRADER_UPGRADING=Upgrading
UPGRADER_NOT_FOR_PATCH=<em>(Only necessary for minor/major upgrades)</em>
UPGRADER_NOT_FOR_HOTFIX=<em>(Not necessary when applying hotfixes)</em>
UPGRADER_TUTORIAL=Carefully (re)read the upgrader tutorial
UPGRADER_BUGS=The developers cannot make any guarantees about the speed of which any new bugs might be patched. It is your own responsibility to make and test a full website backup (files and database) before you upgrade, for if you need to roll-back.
UPGRADER_RELEASE_NOTES=Release notes
UPGRADER_REFER_RELEASE_NOTES=Read the release notes in the announcement for the version you are upgrading to.
UPGRADER_UPGRADE_STEPS=Upgrade steps
UPGRADER_ESTIMATED_TIME=Estimated time
UPGRADER_STEP=Step
UPGRADER_CUSTOMISATIONS=If you are doing a feature/major upgrade and have done a lot of themeing or have a lot of unofficial code it could potentially take up to days, as you would need to update a lot of code due to compatibility breaks.
UPGRADER_DRY_RUN=Do dry-run (show messages but don't actually do anything)
UPGRADER_CHECK_ALL=Tick (check) all
UPGRADER_AUTO_HANDLE=Automatically handle those ticked (checked) &ndash; quarantine/move as needed
UPGRADER_ERROR_CORRECTION=Error correction (useful tools if doing a feature or major upgrade and encounter problems)
NO_ISSUES_FOUND=No issues found

UPGRADER_CLEAR_CACHES=Clear caches

UPGRADER_TAKE_BACKUP=<strong>Take</strong> and <strong>test</strong> a backup, using whatever backup tools you are used to (integrated webhosting-control-panel tools recommended where available)

UPGRADER_CLOSE_SITE=Close the site

UPGRADER_DOWNLOAD=Transfer across new/updated files
UPGRADER_FILE_UPGRADE_INFO=<p>Whenever the developers make a new version of the software, news is posted on <a target="_blank" title="the homesite (this link will open in a new window)" href="{1}/site/news.htm">the homesite</a>. Your Admin Zone will inform you and link direct to that news post. The news post will contain the URL to an upgrade file that you may use to update your site &ndash; feed that URL in here and the upgrader will automatically extract it to the server, skipping files from official addons that you uninstalled.</p>
UPGRADER_DOING_DRY_RUN=Doing dry-run. The messages below reflect what would happen, but no destructive operations will be run.
UPGRADER_FILE_UPGRADE_INFO_MANUAL=<p>You can use a relative URL to your installation if using a local upgrade file; begin the URL with a '/' followed by the relative path.</p><p>You can also use this tool to apply a hotfix instead of a full upgrade; just specify the URL to the hotfix archive file.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> This extraction step can be a bit precarious for large upgrades. If it does not finish correctly you can <a href="{1}" onclick="document.getElementById('wget').style.display='block';">generate a personalised manual upgrader</a> of the latest version which you can extract yourself.</p><p id="wget" style="display: none; overflow-wrap: break-word;">You can extract to your server using commands roughly as follows:<br /><kbd>cd /var/www/html<br />wget -O upgrade.tar "{1}"<br />tar xvf upgrade.tar<br />rm upgrade.tar</kbd></p>
EXTRACTING_MESSAGE=<strong>Extracting files</strong>. Please note that if execution halts without message during file extraction then the operation has not completed due to a timeout. If this happens (it can do on a small proportion of servers) try refreshing a few times to see if this works.
HOTFIX_MESSAGE=<strong>You seem to have provided a hotfix</strong> opposed to a release. Only files belonging to addons you have installed will be extracted, and only if the hotfix file is newer than the one on-disk.
UPGRADER_SKIPPING_MESSAGE=Skipping file (already up-to-date): <kbd>{1}</kbd>
UPGRADER_SKIPPING_MESSAGE_B=Skipping file (on-disk version is newer than upgrade version): <kbd>{1}</kbd>
UPGRADER_EXTRACTING_MESSAGE=Extracting file: <kbd>{1}</kbd>
UPGRADER_RESTART_REQUIRED=<strong>Critical source files for the upgrader have just been updated.</strong> Please go back and re-run this step again to finish the transfer of upgrade files. You may need to re-enter the URL for the upgrade archive.
UPGRADER_RESTART_REQUIRED_NOT_HAPPENING=<strong>Warning!</strong> Critical source files for the upgrader were updated. This normally requires re-running this upgrader step. But because we cannot reliably determine which files were updated between runs, we are proceeding anyway. This is unsupported behaviour. And You may encounter issues after upgrading.
UPGRADER_PACKING_MESSAGE=Packing file into addon archive (for presence upon potential reinstallation): <kbd>{1}</kbd>
UPGRADER_RENAMED_ADDON_MESSAGE=Addon <kbd>{1}</kbd> was renamed to <kbd>{2}</kbd>. You may need to run the file integrity scan after upgrading to remove the old addon.
UPGRADER_NEW_ADDON_EXTRACTED=Extracting new addon <kbd>{1}</kbd>. You may uninstall this addon after upgrading if you desire.
UPGRADER_EXTRACTING_WINDOW=We have done the low-risk updating, and now we need to proceed with the full extraction of {1} new/updated files. It will be performed in the frame below that will work through the files in steps.<br /><strong>Wait until all files are checked and it says &quot;Done!&quot; beneath them</strong>. If the extraction doesn't progress, check to see if you have any browser addons blocking refreshes.
WARNING_MOVED_MODULES=<p>The upgrader has detected that some modules were probably previously moved. However because the new files have been uploaded, the new module files are back where they used to be. You therefore need to do the moving again, overwriting the old versions that were previously moved.</p><ul>{1}</ul>

UPGRADER_INTEGRITY_SCAN=Do a file integrity scan, *with* automatic theme upgrading
UPGRADER_INTEGRITY_SCAN_NO_CSS_MERGE=Do a file integrity scan
UPGRADER_INTEGRITY_SCAN_2=If you made any changes to addons, you may want to <strong>do another file integrity scan</strong> and optionally, run <strong>Check for MySQL schema issues</strong> (if using MySQL).
WARNING_FILE_MISSING_FILE_ENTIRELY=<p>These files are actually missing and need uploading (you can find them in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_MISSING_ORIGINAL_BUT_HAS_OVERRIDE=<p>The following original files to these overridden files are actually missing (you can find them in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_OVERRIDE_FROM_UNINSTALLED_ADDON=<p>The following files are overridden, but the addons for them are uninstalled. You might need to remove your overrides also.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_ORIGINAL_AND_OVERRIDE=<p>The following non-overridden files are outdated, as are the corresponding overridden files (you can find the correct versions for the original in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running, but the overrides may still cause problems and might need removing/replacing):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_ORIGINAL=<p>These files are outdated (you can find the correct versions in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_OVERRIDE=<p>These files which override/customise original files may need to be updated because the original files have been updated. If this is not done, bugs (potentially security holes) may occur, or be left unfixed. If you edited using an inbuilt editor, the file on which you based it will be saved as <kbd>file.editfrom</kbd>: you may use a tool such as <a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WinMerge</a> to compare the <kbd>editfrom</kbd> file to your own, and then apply those same changes to the latest version of the file.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_FUTURE_FILES=<p>These files do not match the ones bundled with your version, but claim to be newer (so these might be bug fixes someone has put here):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_ALIEN=<p>The following alien files were found in the software and potentially should be deleted. It may be that these files are remnants of the previous version or files from uninstalled addons (these ones are pre-ticked/checked), and they may cause problems if left behind. Please check each file to see what it is, and if you believe it to be an outdated file, tick (check) it. Please take a backup first though!</p><p>Note that if the &ldquo;Transfer across new/updated files&rdquo; step extracted new bundled addons, those addon files will show up here (but not pre-ticked/checked) until you run the &ldquo;Do a database upgrade&rdquo; step. You should handle ones you are sure of first, do a database upgrade, then run the file integrity scan again.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_ADDON=<p>The following files relating to non-bundled addons (or bundled addons with a missing <kbd>sources/hooks/systems/addon_registry/</kbd> hook file) were found in the software and possibly should be deleted. They may not be compatible with the version you are currently running, or may belong to addons you no longer have installed. If you delete the files you will be able to restore them by reinstalling the latest versions of the addons involved (the software will help you with this from the Admin Zone).</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_ADDON=<p>The following addons are not compatible with the current version of the software. You will likely need to run your site in safe mode after finishing the upgrade process and update or remove these addons. To update an addon, download the latest version from the homesite and import it under Admin Zone > Structure > Addon management. Sometimes, updated non-bundled addons can automatically be imported on that page.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
FILE_MOVED=A module file, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was apparently moved from the &ldquo;<kbd>{2}</kbd>&rdquo; zone to the &ldquo;<kbd>{3}</kbd>&rdquo; zone previously.
SH_COMMAND=<p>Here is a sh/bash/cygwin command to run on your computer to assist you in isolating out the files to easily batch upload (you need to substitute in <kbd>manual-extracted-at-dir</kbd> and <kbd>temp-dir-to-upload-from</kbd>):<br /><kbd>{1}</kbd></p>
RM_HINT=<p>To delete in Commandr type the following commands separately in sequence:<br /><kbd>cd /raw<br />rm &lt;files-you-decided-to-delete&gt;</kbd><br />(you can copy and paste multi-line file lists onto the end of an Commandr command with no problem)</p>

UPGRADER_DATABASE_UPGRADE=Do a database upgrade (upgrade/install core-database/modules/blocks)
UPGRADER_UPGRADED_CORE_TABLES=<p>Upgraded core tables.</p>
UPGRADER_UPGRADE_MODULES=<p>Upgraded/installed:</p><ul>{1}</ul>

NO_UPGRADE_DONE=<p>Nothing needed to be done for the database upgrade; the in-database version timestamp was updated.</p><p>It is possible the addons/modules/blocks which were upgraded in this version of the software are not installed on your site.</p>

UPGRADER_THEME_UPGRADE=Upgrade themes (runs test first)
AUTO_MERGED=[don't worry this has just been automatically merged using the <kbd>.editfrom</kbd> file, and a revision backup has been taken]
UPGRADER_THEME_ERRORS=Errors (&#x2717;) shown above won't stop the upgrade from happening, but may be indicative of a need for manual intervention after the upgrade is finished. Please keep a copy of them (put them into a document for safe keeping).
UPGRADER_THEME_UPGRADE_FINAL=Go ahead and upgrade themes
UPGRADER_WILL_MERGE=This will attempt to merge in default theme changes to your custom theme CSS. This is not perfect, it will likely result in some small theme errors that you would need to fix manually. Unless the upgrade specifies major theme changes, this step is not necessary. Are you sure you want to do it?
NO_DEFINED_THEME_UPGRADER=There is no theme upgrader available for the version you are upgrading to.
NON_RECOGNISED_CSS_FILE=Could not recognise the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file <kbd>{1}</kbd> as being from version {2}, although we'll try and process it anyway

UPGRADER_OPEN_SITE=Open the site

UPGRADER_CHECK_PERMISSIONS=Check missing/excess permissions, but do not fix them
UPGRADER_FIX_PERMISSIONS=Check and fix missing/excess permissions

UPGRADER_REMOVE_ADDON_FILES=Remove addon files (for developers only)

UPGRADER_SAFE_MODE=Launch site in safe mode [i.e. disable custom files]
UPGRADER_SAFE_MODE_UPGRADE_ADDONS=Enter site in safe mode and upgrade non-bundled addons
UPGRADER_SAFE_MODE_ADMIN=Safe mode does not work when not logged in as an administrator. To facilitate upgrading your site, you were automatically logged in as the first administrator, <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Use SU to log in as another administrator when necessary (e.g. audit purposes).
_UPGRADER_SAFE_MODE_ADMIN=You are already logged in as an administrator, which is good because safe mode requires that. Click the button below to proceed to the Admin Zone in safe mode.

UPGRADER_ADDON_MANAGEMENT=Manage addons (in safe mode)
_UPGRADER_ADDON_MANAGEMENT=You have {1} total installed {1|addon|addons}, some of which may need upgraded. Of those, {2} {2|is|are} not compatible with this version of the software and must be upgraded or removed.

MYSQL_REPAIR=Repair database tables that have become corrupted
TABLE_ERROR=Error found on table {1}&hellip; {2}={3}
TABLE_FIXED=When repairing table {1}&hellip; {2}={3}

CORRECT_MYSQL_SCHEMA_ISSUES=Check for MySQL schema issues (for developers only)
DESCRIPTION_CORRECT_MYSQL_SCHEMA_ISSUES=Programmers will often make changes to MySQL databases manually, but this disadvantages the software because properly written code will create additional structural metadata in the database that is used to provide a rich cross-platform way to query the database (used by the backup system, as well as broken image checking, and various other features). This tool identifies missing schema data and fills in the blanks; it cannot identify exact types so will try and intelligently guess and show the results. This tool also detects various other kinds of inconsistency that could happen with incorrect upgrade processes.
MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MAKE_1=The following queries will make the meta database and the actual database consistent:\n<code class="whitespace-visible">\n{1}</code><br /><br />We did not check against the expected database due to these issues. Manually check these queries and run what you are confident about. They could potentially be removing legitimate modifications you or a non-bundled addon has made.
MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MAKE_2=The following queries will make the actual database consistent with the expected database:\n<code class="whitespace-visible">\n{1}</code><br /><br />There were no issues between the meta database and the actual database. They could potentially be removing legitimate modifications you or a non-bundled addon has made.
NO_MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MAKE=No MySQL schema changes were required.
