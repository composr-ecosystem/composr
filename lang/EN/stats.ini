DOC_STATISTICS=It's important to be able to see graphs and summaries of your site's activity: average visitor counts, which search engine terms are finding your site, the browsers your visitors are using, and so on. The software has a sophisticated statistics system, documented in this tutorial.

HIT=Hit to {1}
STORE_TIME=Access log retention time
CONFIG_OPTION_stats_store_time=The number of days to keep full access logs for.

After around a day, access log stats are transformed into permanent aggregated stats used by the stats addon. However, other parts of the software benefit from access logs held for a longer length of time &ndash; for example, looking up what pages IP addresses or members have been visiting, or showing the number of hits in the last month on the stats block.
