DOC_STATISTICS=It's important to be able to see graphs and summaries of your site's activity: average visitor counts, which search engine terms are finding your site, the browsers your visitors are using, and so on. The software has a sophisticated statistics system, documented in this tutorial.

HIT=Hit to {1}
STORE_TIME=Access log retention time
CONFIG_OPTION_stats_store_time=The number of days to keep full access logs for.
