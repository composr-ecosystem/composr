TICKET_MAIL_TAGS=Allow username tag in subject
CONFIG_OPTION_ticket_mail_tags=Enabling this option allows members to specify their username in the e-mail subject using square brackets, such as <kbd>[myUsername]</kbd>, if e-mailing from an unrecognised address.

It is not recommended to enable this because doing so allows the impersonation of other members by specifying their username in the e-mail to the tickets system.
