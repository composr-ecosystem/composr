POLL_POINT_WEIGHTING=Point-weighting for topic polls
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_POLL_POINT_WEIGHTING=You can enable the ability to weigh votes on topic polls by the number of life-time points voting members earned. This allows communities to provide more decision-making power to more vetted members. Enabling this feature does not automatically enable point weighting for all topic polls; you also need to enable point weighting on the topic polls you wish to be weighted by points.<br /><br />By enabling this feature, members will have a new &ldquo;Voting Power&rdquo; metric on their points profile. When members vote on a topic poll which has point weighting enabled, their impact on the poll results depends on their voting power relative to the voting powers of other members who voted (essentially, for every one voting power, the member has the same influence as one vote).<br /><br />The full calculation for voting power is as follows: <strong>min(Voting power maximum, (Offset + (Multiplier * (life-time points ^ (1 / Root base)))))</strong> (if a member's life-time points is negative, then they will always have 0 voting power).
ENABLE_POLL_POINT_WEIGHTING=Enable point weighting (voting power)
DESCRIPTION_ENABLE_POLL_POINT_WEIGHTING=If enabled, then topic polls can be set to be weighted based on the voting members' voting power (calculated from their life-time points at the time they voted).
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_poll_point_weighting=If enabled, then topic polls can be set to be weighted based on the voting members' voting power (calculated from their life-time points at the time they voted).
TOPIC_POLLS_WEIGHTING_BASE=Root base
CONFIG_OPTION_topic_polls_weighting_base=The root base for calculating voting power (e.g. 2 = square root, 3 = cubic root). Essentially, the higher you set this, the sharper the decline in how fast voting power increases relative to an increase in a member's life-time points. Setting this to '1' or less will result in members' voting powers being equal to their life-time points.
TOPIC_POLLS_WEIGHTING_MULTIPLIER=Multiplier
CONFIG_OPTION_topic_polls_weighting_multiplier=After taking the root of the member's life-time points, we will then multiply by this absolute value when calculating voting power.
TOPIC_POLLS_WEIGHTING_OFFSET=Offset
CONFIG_OPTION_topic_polls_weighting_offset=After applying the root of a member's life-time points and multiplying it by the multiplier, this amount will be added to (if positive) or subtracted from (if negative) the voting power.
TOPIC_POLLS_WEIGHTING_CEILING=Voting power maximum
CONFIG_OPTION_topic_polls_weighting_ceiling=The maximum voting power members may have. If unspecified, then there is no maximum voting power a member may have.
VOTING_POWER=Voting power
DESCRIPTION_VOTING_POWER=The weight of each vote (voting power) is determined by the number of life-time points the voter had when they voted.
TOTAL_VOTING_POWER=Total voting power: {1}
