HEALTH_CHECK=Health Check
DOC_HEALTH_CHECK=The Health Check can run large numbers of automated checks to see if your website is running optimally. It can catch things you might easily have missed, and guide you through manual checks also.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_health_check=Health Check

CONFIG_CATEGORY_HEALTH_CHECK=Health Check options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__HEALTH_CHECK=Options related to the Health Check system. Many of these options are configurable activation thresholds for what qualifies as a problem.

PERFORMANCE=Performance
AUTOMATIC_CHECKS=Automatic checks
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_FLOOD_CONTROL=These options will only work if rate-limiting is enabled and configured. These options don't define additional rate-limits, they just define when to flag up high rates as a health problem to be investigated.

HC_IS_TEST_SITE=Test site
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_is_test_site=Whether this is a test site. Test sites have different (mainly fewer) tests run than a live site.
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_is_test_site_VALUE_-1=Automatic: test site if site is closed

CONFIG_OPTION_hc_is_test_site_VALUE_1=Yes

CONFIG_OPTION_hc_scan_page_links=A list of page-links or URLs to scan for various problems on. List your most important or most failure-prone pages. &ldquo;<kbd>:</kbd>&rdquo; is the home page. You may use the [tt]*[/tt] or [tt]?[/tt] wildcards in the zone or page sections of the page-link. Most checks that run on individual page respect this option; the main exception are checks that can reliably work fast across many pages.

HC_PAGE_SPEED_THRESHOLD=Maximum page load time
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_page_speed_threshold=The maximum time in seconds after which a page request is considered slow. The default threshold is quite high because we may have stale caches or load spiking; we're looking for major issues, not testing our overall optimisation.

HC_REQUESTS_WINDOW_SIZE=Request window size for a visitor
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_requests_window_size=The number of requests within the rate-count window to calculate a &ldquo;Requests per second for a visitor&rdquo; value with. If there are fewer recent requests from the visitor than this then no calculation will be performed and no check done.
HC_COMPOUND_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND_THRESHOLD=Maximum requests per second in total
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_compound_requests_per_second_threshold=The maximum requests per second for all visitors together before it is considered a problem. The problem being a likely <abbr title="Denial Of Service">DDOS</abbr> attack, or just an indication we need more system resources.

HC_CRON_NOTIFY_REGARDLESS=Send full reports
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_cron_notify_regardless=Send notification reports of automatic health checks even if everything passes.

You would calendar yourself to regularly check that you receive these notifications.

HC_VERSION_CHECK=Version check
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_version_check=What kind of Health Check version checking to do. 
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_version_check_VALUE_deprecated=Version is not deprecated
