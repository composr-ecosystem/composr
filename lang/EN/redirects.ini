[strings]
DOC_REDIRECTS=You can set up 2 kinds of redirect: Page Redirects, and URL Redirects. Page Redirects redirect between software pages, while URL Redirects are lower-level and can redirect between any URLs.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_redirects=Redirects

NEW_REDIRECT=New redirect
EXISTING_REDIRECTS=Existing redirects

DOC_PAGE_REDIRECTS=Page Redirects allow you to automatically redirect users from one software zone+page URL to another.\n\nOptionally, this redirection may be 'transparent' such that the user doesn't know a redirection is in place, and thus sees the page as if it was in the zone they accessed it from. For security reasons the user still needs permission to view the page as it would be in its original location.

SET_URL_REDIRECTS=Set URL Redirects
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_MISSING_HTACCESS=An Apache <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file is missing and the URL Redirects feature needs it. We provide a default file you can copy, <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd>.

URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_UNWRITABLE_HTACCESS=The Apache <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file is not writable by the web server. Appropriate permissions need to be set.
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_NOT_APACHE=You probably cannot use URL Redirects because you do not seem to be running the Apache webserver. We will allow you to save redirects but unless your server supports them, it won't work.

URL_REDIRECT_prefix=Prefix: From is a prefix to a URL, remaining portion of the matched URL will be discarded
