DOC_GDPR=The EU GDPR regulation grants rights to users including:\n - Right to be able to access all personal data stored on them\n - Right to be 'forgotten' (have their data scrubbed for deletion or at least anonymised)\nFor this reason there is a privacy module in the Admin Zone for facilitating this, with these features:\n - Ability to download a user's data in a serialised format\n - Ability to mass-delete and/or mass-anonymise all a user's data\n - Ability to generate SQL queries for manually searching the database (useful for making more careful changes)\nThese features can only work based on what the software knows from its database structure. You may hold other data outside the software, or not directly associated via database structure which you will still be responsible for.
TEXT_PRIVACY_SEARCH=Fill at least one field to find matching personal records, to have the selected privacy-action performed.<br /><br />If, given the provided criteria, the software can match against exactly one member, then it will also search for any criteria belonging to that member which was not specified.<br /><br />Be careful to verify whatever search parameters you provide are legitimate, not some kind of fraud or overly-broad criteria. For example, if given an IP address to purge, it is possible that the address might be a dynamic address that was also used by other members. Make sure you have good backups.
TEXT_PRIVACY_DOWNLOAD=Select which tables you wish to download. The data will be downloaded as an archive of JSON files, each table its own JSON file. Any matched personal files which were uploaded to the server will also be included in the archive. The number of records that matched your provided criteria is indicated for each table.<br /><br />Note that in the data, personal fields which did not match against the criteria provided on the previous screen will be anonymised (unless we determined, with confidence, based on the given criteria, this person owns that content). This is to prevent accidental data leaks of other members.
TEXT_PRIVACY_PURGE=For each table, select the action to be performed for every record in the table matching the provided criteria.
TEXT_PRIVACY_SQL=Below is a list of SQL queries to run on the database to view records matching the provided criteria. From there, you can manually review and perform necessary actions on the data.<br /><br />If no SQL queries are visible, then nothing matched the provided criteria (or it is a software bug).
DESCRIPTION_PRIVACY_OTHER=Matching will be performed against any other text field known to only contain user-data, such as phone number, name, or address fields. Be careful with this as it may be overly-broad, it is only rarely useful.

CONFIG_TELEMETRY_MAY_FEATURE=Allow featuring this site on the homesite
CONFIG_OPTION_telemetry_may_feature=Tick (check) this box if you are okay with the staff of the the software homesite featuring your site. This does not guarantee it will be, as featured sites are subject to meeting general criteria (e.g. not being harmful or adult-oriented sites). If your site is currently being featured, and you disable this option, your site will immediately be removed. This setting has no effect if the 'Telemetry' option is set to 'Relay nothing'.
TELEMETRY_STATUS=Telemetry status
DOC_TELEMETRY_STATUS=View your site's status with the homesite telemetry service including the information it knows.
DESCRIPTION_TELEMETRY_STATUS=<p>This page outlines your current registration status with the the software homesite's telemetry service.

You can either enable it in the Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Privacy / legal compliance options, or you can edit <kbd>data/installed.php</kbd> to instruct the homesite to delete all your data.
TELEMETRY_NOT_REGISTERED=Your site does not appear to be registered in the the software homesite's telemetry service.<br /><br />If you believe this is an error (you have telemetry enabled in Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Privacy / legal compliance options), try running this PHP code in Commandr (prefix :) or in 'data_custom/execute_temp.php': <kbd>require_code('telemetry'); register_site_telemetry();</kbd>
TELEMETRY_SUPP=<p>Telemetry is a secure process by which your site relays information to the the software homesite (which helps core developers fix bugs and improve the software). Data transmitted is encrypted using special keys located in <kbd>data/keys</kbd> and <kbd>data_custom/keys</kbd>.</p><p>To change your telemetry settings, go to Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Privacy / legal compliance options.<p>To request permanent deletion of your telemetry data from the homesite, see instructions in <kbd>data/installed.php</kbd>.</p><p>Below, you will find a summary of what the homesite currently knows about your site through what it sent in telemetry.</p>
TELEMETRY_STATUS_ERROR=There was a problem connecting to the homesite to check on your telemetry status. Please try again later. Ensure your site can connect to {1}.
TELEMETRY_STATUS_ERROR_2=The telemetry service returned an error when trying to check your telemetry status. It is possible your site was not correctly registered. Try disabling telemetry (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Privacy / legal compliance options) (save), re-enable telemetry (and save), and check again. If this problem continues, please <a href="{1}/report-issue.htm" target="_blank" title="Report issue (opens in new window)">report an issue on the tracker</a>.
TELEMETRY_STILL_REGISTERED=According to the telemetry service, your site is still registered and its data still present. If you want the telemetry service to delete all your data, edit your <kbd>data/installed.php</kbd> file according to the instructions in its comments. This message will disappear once you are no-longer registered in the service.
TELEMETRY_FAILED_TO_REGISTER=We failed to register your site with the homesite telemetry service. This could be because of a variety of reasons: telemetry is disabled in your configuration, your server does not support the <kbd>libsodium</kbd> PHP extension, the homesite is down at this time, or the homesite could not verify site ownership through <kbd>data/installed.php</kbd> (maybe it cannot access this file over the Internet?). Please try again later. If this issue continues, you may wish to report this as a bug <a href="{1}/report-issue.htm">to the tracker</a>.
