DOC_GDPR=The EU GDPR regulation grants rights to users including:\n - Right to be able to access all personal data stored on them\n - Right to be 'forgotten' (have their data scrubbed for deletion or at least anonymised)\nFor this reason there is a privacy module in the Admin Zone for facilitating this, with these features:\n - Ability to download a user's data in a serialised format\n - Ability to mass-delete and/or mass-anonymise all a user's data\n - Ability to generate SQL queries for manually searching the database (useful for making more careful changes)\nThese features can only work based on what the software knows from its database structure. You may hold other data outside the software, or not directly associated via database structure which you will still be responsible for.
TEXT_PRIVACY_SEARCH=Fill at least one field to find matching personal records, to have the selected privacy-action performed.<br /><br />If, given the provided criteria, the software can match against exactly one member, then it will also search for any criteria belonging to that member which was not specified.<br /><br />Be careful to verify whatever search parameters you provide are legitimate, not some kind of fraud or overly-broad criteria. For example, if given an IP address to purge, it is possible that the address might be a dynamic address that was also used by other members. Make sure you have good backups.
TEXT_PRIVACY_DOWNLOAD=Select which tables you wish to download. The data will be downloaded as an archive of JSON files, each table its own JSON file. The number of records that matched your provided criteria is indicated for each table.<br /><br />Note that personal data fields which do not match the provided criteria will be anonymised to prevent accidental leaking of data from other individuals.
TEXT_PRIVACY_PURGE=For each table, select the action to be performed for every record in the table matching the provided criteria.
TEXT_PRIVACY_SQL=Below is a list of SQL queries to run on the database to view records matching the provided criteria. From there, you can manually review and perform necessary actions on the data.<br /><br />If no SQL queries are visible, then nothing matched the provided criteria (or it is a software bug).
DESCRIPTION_PRIVACY_OTHER=Matching will be performed against any other text field known to only contain user-data, such as phone number, name, or address fields. Be careful with this as it may be overly-broad, it is only rarely useful.

This may be stipulated if you are operating from the EU or as an EU organisation, or possibly in other jurisdictions (check local laws).

The software sets reasonable policies on its own cookies (minimisation, short/temporary-lifetimes, anonymisation, explicit opt-in, often staff-only), but the EU laws are written in very broad and vague terms and the developers cannot interpret them for you. The consent feature is powered by the <a href="https://silktide.com/tools/cookie-consent/" target="_blank" title="Silktide Cookie Consent tool (this link will open in a new window)">Silktide Cookie Consent tool</a>.

CONFIG_OPTION_privacy_download_days=Members may only download their personal data once every specified number of days. This excludes uses of the privacy tool in the Admin Zone. Set to '0' to disable the limit. Set to a negative number to require that members contact staff for a copy of their data.
PRIVACY_PURGE_DAYS=Days between purging data
CONFIG_OPTION_privacy_purge_days=Members may only purge their personal data once every specified number of days. This excludes uses of the privacy tool in the Admin Zone. Set to '0' to disable the limit. Set to a negative number to require that members contact staff if they want their data purged.

PRIVACY_UPON_MEMBER_DELETE=Purge upon member delete
