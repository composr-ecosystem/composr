[strings]
DOC_WORDFILTER=There is a simple word filter which will allow you to prevent a list of words from appearing on your site, unless the user that posts them has the privilege to bypass the word filter.
OBSCENITY_WARNING=This page allows management of filtered words. Be warned that by expanding the page interface, you will be subjected to a list of these words: if you or people close to you might be offended by such a list, hold-back this action. This software is pre-programmed with a default list, that we feel most English speaking websites would want filtering; depending on your website's level of liberalism or censorship, or your language, you may wish to make major changes to the list.
