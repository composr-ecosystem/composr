 * Hook class.
 * Points hooks should follow this naming convention according to points_ledger column names: t_type__t_subtype (or just t_type to match all t_subtypes). By defining a hook accordingly, you are indicating that all transactions matching the t_type (and t_subtype if applicable) are considered 'low-impact'. This means they will be hidden from ledger tables on members' point profiles and instead displayed as a cumulative tally (determined by the points_profile function) at the top of their points profile.
