Message,Summary,How did this happen?,How do I fix it?
MySQL client ran out of memory,MySQL could not serve a Composr database request because it ran out of memory.,"Either
 - A database table contains a very large amount of data
 - The server is configured to have a very low limit
 - Your server is overloaded
",Contact your webhost for advice on how to fix it. Or consult the MySQL documentation.
The SELECT would examine more than MAX_JOIN_SIZE rows,MySQL could not serve a Composr database request because a configured limit was exceeded.,"Either
 - A database table contains a very large amount of data
 - The server is configured to have a very low limit","There is currently no straight-forward fix to this problem. It may be a bug, or it may be a server configuration problem. Make a judgement call whether to contact your webhost or whether to post to the issue tracker. You may also wish to consult the MySQL documentation."
Can't open file: 'xxx.MYI',A MySQL data file has corrupted or gone missing on your server.,"Something outside the control of Composr caused this error, such as a hard disk fault, a power surge, a power cut, a forced computer reset, or a system administration mistake.",Contact your webhost or the MySQL documentation. Anticipate that you may need to restore a backed up database.
Lost connection to MySQL server,MySQL was not able to serve a Composr database request.,"There are three likely possible causes:
1) The MySQL server is overloaded
2) The web server is overloaded
3) You have a particularly large amount of data (less likely)",Contact your webhost or MySQL configuration.
MySQL server has gone away,MySQL was not able to serve a Composr database request.,"There are three likely possible causes:
1) The MySQL server is overloaded
2) The web server is overloaded
3) You have a particularly large amount of data (less likely)",Contact your webhost or MySQL configuration.
Got packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes,MySQL was not able to serve a particularly large Composr database request.,It is likely you're trying to insert a very large amount of data into a Composr entry.,Consider breaking your data over a number of separate entries / queries.
Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket,Composr cannot connect to the MySQL database.,"It is likely that either:
1) MySQL is no longer running on the server.
2) The MySQL server is (no longer) running on the same physical server as your web server (""""localhost"""").","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong database hostname. Your webhost, or webhosting control panel, likely provides documentation indicating what the correct setting is.

Otherwise, contact your webhost."
Can't connect to MySQL server on xxx,Composr cannot connect to the MySQL database.,"It is likely that either:
1) MySQL is no longer running on the server and needs resetting.
2) MySQL is intentionally (no longer) running on the server.
3) Your firewall is blocking the connection between your web server and the MySQL server.","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong database hostname. Your webhost, or webhosting control panel, likely provides documentation indicating what the correct setting is.

If the MySQL server you are trying to access is on a different computer network to the web server it is likely you will need to use a different MySQL server. Most physical machines running web servers also run MySQL servers, so it is likely you can use 'localhost' as the MySQL server.

Otherwise, contact your webhost."
Access denied for user xxx,"Composr cannot connect to the MySQL server with the configured username and password.

[i]This advice is not relevant if you got the larger error message: Access denied for user xxx to database xxx[/i]","This could happen for a number of reasons:
1) You have configured Composr to use the wrong MySQL username and/or password.
2) The MySQL username and/or password you configured have been changed or removed.
3) You have moved your website to a new web server and not correctly updated the Composr configuration and/or set up your database.
4) If your MySQL server and web server are different physical machines it is important MySQL is configured to allow connections from the web server machine (or all machines) [i]for your configured username[/i]. This is not the default configuration.","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong username/password. Your webhosting control panel likely provides documentation an interface where you can configure MySQL usernames and password. Note that on some webhosts you enter a username but it gets given a prefix - if this is the case it should be indicated in the webhosting control panel.

If you have recently changed your MySQL username/password or moved web servers you can edit your configured 'Installation Options'. Call up the '/config_editor.php' script (by URL) and log in to it. You can update your configuration from there.

If your MySQL server and web server are different physical machines then you will need to either change that situation, or make some changes to your MySQL credentials. It may be as simple as choosing to allow 'Any host' to make connections. Some webhosting control panels allow you to change these settings."
Access denied for user xxx to database xxx,Composr cannot connect to the MySQL database with the configured username and password.,"You are likely using correct settings to connect to your database, but MySQL has not been configured correctly.",Make sure that the username you have configured has access to the database you have configured. You will be able to do this from your webhosting control panel or a tool such as PhpMyAdmin. You could also do this through raw SQL (consult the MySQL documentation). This is not automatic even if the username and database name are the same.
Unknown database xxx,The configured database that Composr should use is not present on the MySQL server.,"This could happen for a number of reasons:
1) You have configured Composr to use the wrong MySQL database.
2) The MySQL database you configured has been renamed or removed.
3) You have moved your website to a new web server and not correctly updated the Composr configuration and/or set up your database.","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong database name. Your webhosting control panel likely provides documentation an interface where you can manage your MySQL databases.

You can edit your configured 'Installation Options'. Call up the '/config_editor.php' script (by URL) and log in to it. You can update your configuration from there."
The PHP XML extension on your server is needed to use this feature,"Composr is trying to work with [abbr=""""eXtensible Markup Language""""]XML[/abbr] but your web server is not capable of doing it in the standard way.",The web server's PHP configuration does not enable the 'XML' extension. It is usually enabled by default.,"Consult with your webhost, choose a different webhost, or configure your PHP settings to enable the XML extension (and restart)."
The PHP FTP extension on your server is needed to use this feature,Composr is trying to write some files and it does not have access to them.,"To access files for writing Composr needs the server to be configured as 'suEXEC' or it needs to be able to use an [abbr=""""File Transfer Protocol""""]FTP[/abbr] connection to do the work. Neither of these options are available.

[i]Note that this advice is not relevant for Windows servers.[/i]","Consult with your webhost. Let them know you need either:
 - PHP to have the FTP extensions enabled, and an FTP server to be running
 - suEXEC to be enabled (this is a major change for a webhost to implement but the Composr core team strongly recommends it)
If you are able, you can try enabling the FTP extension in PHP yourself (and restart)."
"You are using a shared install, which makes this action prohibited",You are trying to do a low-level administrative action but cannot as you are on a shared install.,"You cannot perform certain actions on shared installs, either for security reasons, or because it would impact all other websites.","There is no way around this. If it is a problem for you please discuss it on the Composr forums."
The TAR file xxx is corrupt,"You tried to use a corrupted TAR file, such as a corrupted addon archive.",The file likely corrupted at some point when being downloaded/uploaded.,Try again or get a new copy of the file. If the problem persists then contact the creator of the file. If it was generated or download from Composr then make an issue on the issue tracker.
A block file is missing: xxx,You have referenced a file that does not exist.,It is likely you used the Comcode or Tempcode block tag but you used the name of a block that is non-existent. It is also possible you referenced a real block but then later uninstalled the addon that contains that block.,"Correct the name of the block referenced, or remove the appropriate Comcode or Tempcode, or reinstall the block (or addon) in the Admin Zone > Structure > Addons > Module management."
A template file is missing: xxx,Some Composr code referenced a file that does not exist.,"It is likely the file did not upload correctly when you installed/upgraded, or you mistyped the name of the template.","You can use the 'Integrity checker' option within the upgrader to find a list of all missing files. You can access the upgrader by calling up the '/upgrader.php' URL on your site.

Otherwise, you may have found a bug. It is possible that the software may neglect to pass a parameter in certain usages of a template. No errors of this type are left unfixed, but it is a common problem.",If you recognise that the error might stem from a template change you have made then fix your template. Otherwise submit an issue to the tracker so it can be fixed.
The requested resource does not exist,"A resource (usually a piece of content or a category of content) is being referenced or linked to by name/identifier, but there is no such resource.","Common causes include:
1) If you delete something and then use your back button to try and access what you just deleted.
2) If you follow a link to something that has since been deleted.
3) A search engine bot is crawling your site and checking for resources (the bot should correct itself for ones that it finds missing).

It is also possible that there is some form of corruption in the database. For example, an entry says it is in a category that doesn't actually exist.","Fix any invalid links if applicable, or set up a URL redirect to point that link somewhere else.

Table 'xxx' is marked as crashed and ,There is a corrupt MySQL database table. Composr needs this table to function.,"Something outside the control of Composr caused this error, such as a hard disk fault, a power surge, a power cut, the forced termination of a PHP process, or a forced computer reset.","Your webhost will almost certainly provide a webhosting control panel with a tool called 'phpMyAdmin' (it may be called something else, such as 'Database management').
1) Access / Log in to this tool
2) Make sure you are in the database that Composr uses
3) Tick (check) the table referenced in the error message.
4) Scroll to the bottom of the screen.
5) In the 'With selected' option list, choose 'Repair table'.
5) You should see the page reload with a message stating the repair was successful.

If in doubt or if the table will not repair, contact your webhost.

Composr also offers a database repair tool in the upgrader. Call up '/upgrader.php' to run it.

"A critical parameter, xxx, was missing ",An invalid URL was used.,"It is likely part of a URL was missing. The URL was to a real Composr page, but it required some parameters that were not passed. For example, linking to the Composr page/screen-type for viewing downloads without specifying what download to view within the URL.

Some web spiders (automatic programs that read websites) can cause these errors because they will try and guess URLs based on other URLs.

Alternatively (and less likely), your server may be redirecting the domain you're using to another one in such a way that parameter information is lost.","Provide the required parameters for the URL.

2) There is a permission problem on the target directory.
3) There is an 'open_basedir' restriction in place that does not allow access to the upload temporary directory.","First check the permissions on your target directory. There are tools in the upgrader script to check and repair permissions. 
You can access the upgrader by calling up the '/upgrader.php' URL on your site.

If you still have not been able to solve the problem contact your webhost and ask them to investigate for you."
Cannot write to xxx. File permissions for it (or the directory it is in) have not been set correctly,The server could not edit/create a file/directory.,Your file permissions aren't correct.,"There are tools in the upgrader script to check and repair permissions. 
You can access the upgrader by calling up the '/upgrader.php' URL on your site."
Cannot create a directory xxx. This file should have existed anyway,A directory was needed but missing. Composr tried to create it but failed.,This happens often when people upload a new language pack without adding it first by starting a translation via the language tools in the Style section of the Admin Zone.,"Create the directory manually via an [abbr=""""File Transfer Protocol""""]FTP[/abbr] client, or some other file management tool if you prefer."
Cannot create a xxx file. File permissions for the xxx directory likely have not been set correctly.,The server could not create a file.,Your file permissions aren't correct.,"There are tools in the upgrader script to check and repair permissions.
You can access the upgrader by calling up the '/upgrader.php' URL on your site."
Could not save. Are you out of disk space or quota space? The file failed to save in a temporary directory,Composr failed to create a temporary file.,"It is likely either:
1) the server is out of disk space on it's temporary directory (sometimes temporary directories are on different partitions/disks to website directories)
2) the quota on the temporary directory has been exceeded",Consult with your webhost.
A system e-mail could not be sent,Your web server is unable to send e-mails.,"It is likely that either:
 - You are on a Windows server and nobody has configured the PHP SMTP settings (in the [tt]php.ini[/tt] file).
 - You are on a Linux server and there is no outgoing e-mail service on it (e.g. sendmail, postfix, qmail).","The system administrator should resolve the problem by making the correct [tt]php.ini[/tt] settings or setting up an e-mail server.

You can try and work around the problem by configuring Composr to send e-mail through a different SMTP server using its own code (configure this under the Admin Zone, Setup Section, Configuration icon, 'Site options')."
The necessary forum for this has not yet been created,You selected a forum in a configuration setting which does not exist.,"Addons which have configuration options involving forums might set an arbitrary forum ID which does not exist yet as its default. Or, you might have defined a forum which existed at one point but does not anymore.","Go into the configuration setting and change it to a forum which exists."
A configuration option (xxx) which does not exist was referenced,Some code or template is trying to access the value of a configuration option which does not exist.,"This can happen when you mis-type the name of the configuration option. It can also happen if the addon containing the option is no-longer installed or was never installed (this is a bug and should be reported to the tracker).","Check to ensure you typed the configuration option name correctly and that it exists, e.g. a hook exists for it under [tt]hooks/systems/config[/tt]. You might also need to clear caches (template, self-learning, block) in Admin Zone > Tools > Cleanup tools."
Form field $description parameters should end in full stops,A description for a form field lacked a full stop.,You created or modified a language string which is used as a form field description and lacked a full stop.,"Fix the responsible language string so it ends in a full stop (usually a period, end bracket / brace, question mark, exclamation point, or ending HTML kbd tag."
"Form field with $name 'xxx' is not allowed as it does not work reliably with autofill, use 'xxx' instead.",A form field name used interferes with autocomplete.,You tried to name a form field with something that is commonly used as a key for auto-completion.,Use the suggested name for your form field instead.
