# About Composr CMS #

Composr is a CMS with many social media features, for building modern, sophisticated websites. Composr supports many types of content (galleries, news/newsletters, etc.) - and integrating rich media and advertising into them. Social features include forums, member blogs, chatrooms, wiki, and content commenting/rating.

Composr lets you decide how your site will look and behave. Features are plentiful, but also optional. Feature integration is at the core of the Composr philosophy - for example, the site-wide search engine, and the unified member profiles.
