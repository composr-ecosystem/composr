			[title sub="Considering helping out?"]Contribute[/title]

			<p>Do you want to help [page="site:vision"]our mission[/page]: bringing a way that empowers the masses to create feature-rich websites on saner budgets?</p>

			<p>It's a lofty goal, and we'd love your help!</p>

			<h2 class="h3Like" style="margin-bottom:0">Why do you want <em>my</em> help?</h2>

			<div class="sept"></div>

			<p>By virtue of the fact that you are reading this, you have at least some interest in web development and/or Composr. This makes you perfect:</p>

			<ul class="cntLi">
				<li>The enthusiasm of you and others is key: so many jobs, such as spreading the word, could never be done well automatically &ndash; and if we tried to do everything ourselves, we couldn't sustain the product and community.</li>
				<li>You're different. Different from us, and different from many other Composr users &ndash; either in little or big ways. This diversity is exactly what we need - a variety of skills make Composr more valuable for everybody. Share your own special perspectives and talents.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Whether you're a developer, a good writer, have some cash to help drive the project, or just have some darned-good ideas, you can support Composr.</p>

			<h2 class="text-center h3Like" style="margin-bottom:0">Here are a few ideas of ways to help</h2>

			<h3>Why do it?</h3>

			<div class="sept"></div>

			<p class="lonely_label">All Composr users can have a stake in Composr's success:</p>
			<ul class="cntLi">
				<li>[b]Get noticed[/b]: People who contribute significantly will be well respected and thanked by the community. It feels good!</li>
				<li>[b]Build a career[/b]: Members who've made big contributions are automatically highlighted via our [page="site:stars"]community stars[/page] and [page="site:groups"]ranks[/page]. This is definitely something worth putting on your CV/Résumé.</li>
				<li>[b]Build a business[/b]: We have a directory of [page="site:partners"]partners[/page] and we actively refer out projects that come through to third-party implementors (it's even a part of our project briefing wizard). Your role and importance in the community could directly lead to paid work for you.</li>
				<li>[b]Move things forward[/b]: You're making the web development world a better place for people who aren't necessarily programmers or millionaires. By its very nature the Open Source model depends on people to share talents in big and small ways.</li>
				<li>[b]Give back[/b]: You can be a big help to the hard-working core developer team who've continued to spend years on very modest incomes to see the vision come to pass. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How to get started</h3>

			<div class="sept"></div>

			<p>Just go ahead and pick something on the above list and go for it! Be a self-starter and don't let anything hold you back. Again &ndash; even tiny efforts like micro-blogging do some good for the project. So why not?</p>
