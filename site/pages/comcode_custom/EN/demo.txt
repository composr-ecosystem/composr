[title="2"]Personal demo[/title]

To set up your personal demo we just need a few details from you:
 - A name for the demo which we'll use in your temporary URL.
 - Your e-mail address (so e-mails on the demo go to you, and so we can keep in contact).
 - A password for you to log in to the demo with.

Please note that because this is a demo system, your demo will only last a few days. Composr is free, but you will need to find a webhost.
