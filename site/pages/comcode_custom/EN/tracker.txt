		<p>The core developers are unlikely to step through solutions outside paid support, but if you can phrase questions in a general way and lots of people vote them up, the chance goes up a tutorial could be made at some point.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Complex written tutorials take about an hour to make.</li>
			<li>Step-through videos take about 5 times longer to make than they are in length, e.g. a 12 minute video would take about 1 hour to make.</li>

[title="2"]How is Composr developed?[/title]

Composr was originally developed and supported by ocProducts Ltd. It is now a community project, transitioning to a new governance model. For now, the main original founder is sponsoring further development directly.

Before you make requests, it's a good idea to check they aren't already made, and that you are only posting something generic enough to be useful for 15% of users or higher. Be aware that money may be needed in some cases to get traction on things (looks at the stats below to see how much has already been contributed, but why the developers do need to get most future development funded). Ideas are always extremely welcome regardless, even if only for inspiration or to help us all see the path ahead.

[title="2"]Where do the cost estimates come from?[/title]

[hide="If you don't mind some maths, we're happy to reveal the exact costings"][html]<p>The hourly development time is estimated, then cost is calculated at a support cost of 33 GBP/hour.</p>

<p><strong>So where does this figure come from?</strong></p>

<p>It was originally derived as what ocProducts Ltd would need to draw in to pay its development staff, back in 2004. A lot has changed since then and ocProducts Ltd is no longer the main force behind the Composr CMS product, so actual figures will depend on who is willing to do the work.</p>
