    Currently, this only supports giving ratings, not receiving ratings. It would take too many resources and computations to figure out received ratings.

    2) types    -- Limit to these feedback types (not specified: no filter)
    2) days     -- Only consider ratings made within this many days [persist is not supported if this is specified] (not specified: no filter)
