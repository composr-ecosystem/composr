    This script is used by the homesite's install statistics service. It simply tells the homesite if a website is
    installed here based on the presence of _config.php and sources/bootstrap.php. Since htaccess blocks _config.php,
    we must use an API like this to determine an installation.

    The homesite will only query if you elected to provide statistics when you installed your site.
    And if this file no longer exists or reports the software is not installed, the homesite will stop querying
    for this file after a year.

    If you want your site to be immediately removed and the homesite to stop checking you, uncomment the echo line
    'Remove me!'. When the homesite sees this, it will immediately remove you from its install statistics service.
