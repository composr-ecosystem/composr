If you have a Composr CMS v11 site, you can opt-in (or out) to have it featured when installing (on step 2) or in your configuration in the Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Privacy / legal compliance options. See the [page="_SEARCH:community-sites"]site showcase[/page] for more information.

Remember, version 11 is still in beta. We do not recommend running it in production unless you are aware of the responsibilities and implications (e.g. you will probably have some bugs which could affect operations or even corrupt data, and v11 might have undetected security issues).
