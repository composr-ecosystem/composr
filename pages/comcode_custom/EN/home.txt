<p>Would you like your v11 site featured? When installing v11, on the licence agreement / terms page, indicate that we may feature your site. Note that setting this option does not guarantee we will feature your site.</p>

<p>Remember, version 11 is still in beta. We do not recommend running it in production unless you know what you are doing and are aware of the responsibilities and implications (especially security and stability).</p>[/semihtml]
