[title]Addon Submission[/title]

We encourage anyone with the skills and the time available to develop non-bundled addons and themes for Composr. By doing so, you enable others to further extend their Composr sites with features not covered by the core developers. And you get a bit of coding experience in the process!

[title="2"]Points[/title]

To encourage high-quality and useful addons / themes, core developers use a rubric as outlined below for judging whether an addon / theme gets accepted into the Composr non-bundled addons repository, and how many points you receive as a reward. These points are assigned an appropriate role which could also list you on the [page=":stars"]community stars[/page] page.

[b]If you score 1,500 points or more below, the addon will also receive a featured award and get additional promotion[/b].

The points awarded is based on the following rubric used by the core developers:
[list default="normal"]
[*][b]Innovation[/b]: How innovative is your addon / theme?
 - Brings nothing new to Composr / unnecessarily reinvents the wheel: [i]will get rejected; instead, you can instead share it on the forums[/i]
 - Improves on something Composr already has: 100 points
 - Not seen in Composr but found in some other CMS': 250 points
 - Neither seen in Composr nor in most CMS': 500 points
 - Something that blows the minds of even the core developers: 1,000 points
[*][b]Usefulness[/b]: How useful would this addon / theme be for the general public?
 - Unlikely to be used by anyone but you: [i]will get rejected; you can instead share it on the forums[/i]
 - May be useful for a few sites: 50 points
 - May be useful for several sites: 100 points
 - May be useful for many sites: 250 points
Add 250 points if the core developers decide to use it on composr.app.
[*][b]Code Quality[/b]: How closely did you conform to our [page="docs:codebook"]coding standards[/page]?
 - Does not follow even basic PHP standards: [i]will get rejected; we will recommend you fix the code before sharing it[/i]
 - Follows basic PHP standards but not Composr standards: [i]will get rejected unless it's made as a minimodule / miniblock[/i]
 - Follows PHP standards and basic Composr standards: 50 points
 - Follows PHP standards and most of Composr's standards: 150 points
 - Cannot be differentiated in quality from core code: 250 points
[*][b]Bugs[/b]: Does it work?:
 - One or more core features are broken, or it breaks something else in Composr: [i]will get rejected; you will be asked to fix your addon / theme and seek help from the community[/i]
 - The addon is very slow or inefficient: [i]will get rejected; you will be asked to fix your addon / theme and seek help from the community[/i]
 - One or more considerable security issues were detected: [i]will get rejected; you will be asked to fix your addon / theme and seek help from the community[/i]
 - Minor bugs exist which the developers believe should have easily been spotted: [i]will get rejected; you will be asked to fix your addon / theme and seek help from the community[/i]
 - Minor bugs exist which were not easily spotted but the addon / theme can still be used: 100 points, but you will be encouraged to fix the bugs
 - No bugs detected, but the addon is moderately slow / inefficient: 100 points, but you will be encouraged to optimise
 - No bugs detected, and the addon is fast / efficient: 250 points
[*][b]Documentation[/b] (usually addons only): Did you write tutorials, and how good of quality are they?
 - No tutorials: 0 points (tutorials are optional, so this will not necessarily result in a rejection)
 - Low quality, or contains no relevant screenshots or videos: 50 points (it may be rejected if the grammar and spelling are below standards)
 - Moderate quality and includes at least one relevant screenshot: 100 points
 - Good quality (thorough, covers all features and concepts, and similar [or better] to the quality of a tutorial written by a core developer): 150 points
 - Good quality and also includes video demonstrations: 250 points
[/list]

In addition to the above, you will also receive points when someone likes the addon. Members can individually send you points as a thank-you for the addon. And you will get points when you regularly maintain and update the addon / theme.
