[title]Features[/title]

[contents][/contents]

Here, we have a summary of Composr's major features. As you'll see, you have many to pick from! The features listed on this page are all included by default and out of the box with Composr; no downloading additional addons necessary!

Almost every feature in Composr is optional. Anything you don't want you can uninstall in the Admin Zone > Structure > Addons, or through the Setup Wizard.
