[semihtml]<p>[contents levels="3"][/contents]&nbsp;</p>[title="1"]Composr Community Ecosystem[/title]
<p>The Composr community operates on the Bazaar model which is an open and democratic system. Every member of the Composr community can play a vital role in the community whether that is through development, funding, support, services, promotion, moderation, testing, reporting issues, or voting on decisions. There is no central company to Composr. And there are no central members. While there is a Board to help guide the decisions, and a Core Development Team who does most of the development, the members as a collective whole have the final say-so in the direction of Composr.</p>

<p>It is essential for the Composr community and its members to participate in the ecosystem if they can do so (however much or little they can).&nbsp;By doing so, we establish a continuous giving/receiving circle of contributions which benefit everyone and the Composr project as a whole.</p>[title="2"]Code Contributions / Reporting Issues[/title]
<p>Composr CMS is Free and Open Source (FOSS). This means that the software itself is free to download and use subject to its licence terms. Furthermore, anyone can view the full source code of the software at any time both when they download it and <a href="https://gitlab.com/composr-foundation/composr">through our GitLab&nbsp;repository</a>. By opening the source code up to the public, anyone can inspect it and offer bug fixes, feature implementations, and security patches. These are done through our <a href="https://composr.app/tracker/">issue tracker</a> and through making merge requests to the repository.</p>[title="2"]Free and Paid Support[/title]
<p>While the software itself is free, there shall not be any expectation of free support for the software. Members may <a href="https://composr.app/forum/">collaborate freely on the forum</a> regarding issues, suggestions, or development of Composr or personal Composr websites. But members do so on their own agenda; no member has an expectation to offer free support. And members shall not expect a free&nbsp;answer to their questions every time they ask.</p>

<p>Members and companies are allowed, and encouraged, to exchange their paid professional support services for Composr through our platform.&nbsp;Those who offer professional support should consider creating a listing on our <a href="https://composr.app/partners.htm">Composr Partners</a> page, and to link to their entry in their signature. That way, those looking for paid / professional support can quickly refer to that directory and contact someone to hire them.</p>

<p>If you would like some tips and guidelines on how to provide paid professional support to others, you can check out <a href="https://composr.app/docs/sup-running-agency.htm">this tutorial on how to run a web agency</a>&nbsp;(and the &quot;See Also&quot; documents listed on that tutorial). You can also ask questions on the (TODO) forum specific for web agencies.</p>[title="2"]The Points System&nbsp;[/title]
<p>Composr.app utilises a points system. Members receive points for a variety of reasons which they can track on their profile points page. Here are some of the ways members can earn points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Activity in the forums</li>
	<li>Reporting issues to the tracker (which later get resolved or implemented)</li>
	<li>Resolving tracker issues (you also collect any points which were sponsored / escrowed on the issue by other members)</li>
	<li>Publishing addons</li>
	<li>Publishing tutorials</li>
	<li>Making code contributions to the Composr GitLab repository</li>
	<li>Being a great community ambassador (this is indirect; members can give each other points for various good deeds)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where you receive points from other members, a &quot;role&quot; may be assigned to the transaction / reason, which means you could get listed in one of several <a href="https://composr.app/stars.htm">Community Stars</a> categories.</p>[title="3"]Voting Power&nbsp;[/title]
<p>The primary use of points is voting power. As you earn points, your &quot;life-time points&quot; count goes up, and consequentially your voting power increases. When you vote in polls regarding decisions for the Composr community, the amount of influence your vote has in the poll depends on your voting power. The more voting power you have, the more influence your vote has. Therefore, the more active you are in the Composr community, the bigger your digital voice is in these votes / polls.</p>[title="3"]Sponsorships&nbsp;[/title]
<p>Another use for points is to sponsor them on issues. If you see an issue or feature on the <a href="https://compo.sr/tracker/">tracker</a>&nbsp;that is important to you and you&#39;d like to see resolved or implemented, you can sponsor points on the issue. Sponsoring issues will encourage other members / developers to implement the issue because they will receive your sponsored points by doing so. When you sponsor points, you escrow them on the issue (spend them immediately to the system, which then get awarded to whomever resolves the issue, or they get refunded back to you if the issue is closed).</p>[title="3"]Escrows&nbsp;(transactions)[/title]
<p>Another use for points is to exchange them with other members in escrow for a product or service. You can do this by going to the member&#39;s profile, click their points tab, and click to escrow points to them. You will be asked how much to escrow, a deadline if applicable, and a list of terms that must be satisfied for the escrow transaction to be completed (for example, if you&#39;re using points to have someone implement a new feature on your site, you would detail those terms on the escrow).</p>

<p>When you have determined the escrow as satisfied, you can mark it off as such. And the other member can do so as well. Once both of you have marked the escrow satisfied, the other member will receive your points. If either of you have a dispute, you can dispute the escrow, which calls upon a staff member to intervene and decide how to handle the escrow.&nbsp;</p>[title="3"]Giving Points&nbsp;[/title]
<p>The final use of points is simply to give them to other members for good deeds or being helpful. You can do this by going to a member&#39;s profile, click points, and fill out the short form under &quot;Give Points&quot;. You can also select a &quot;role&quot; for your gift, which if you do, will tally your gift against the member&#39;s other gifts in that category and potentially list them on the <a href="https://composr.app/stars.htm">Community Stars</a> page.</p>

<p>You can also give points to a member by clicking a &quot;Thank&quot; button on one of their forum posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regularly giving points to members who contribute positive things to the community will reinforce their positive behaviour and encourage other members to do the same.</p>[/semihtml]
