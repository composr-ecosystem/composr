[title="2"]Before you Download[/title]

Check out our [page=":catalogues:category:6"]FAQ[/page] before downloading and installing version 11 beta.

[box="Are you upgrading?"]
Instead of using this page, you should go to your Admin Zone dashboard to upgrade your site. You can also [page=":news:browse:11"]browse our release archives[/page] to generate a personal upgrader file, and then go to [tt]yourbaseurl/upgrader.php[/tt] to upgrade using your personal upgrader.

[b]We highly advise against upgrading from version 10 at this time.[/b] Version 11 is still bleeding edge and intended for testing purposes only; the upgrader will likely break your v10 site.

[title="2"]Download / Transfer Files[/title]

Transfer the installation files to your server. Here are our latest available versions of Composr CMS:

After doing that, go to [tt]yourbaseurl/install.php[/tt] to run the install wizard.

[title="3"]For Developers[/title]

[url="Git"]http://git-scm.com/[/url] is the revision control system we use to collaborate on Composr's development. You can access our GitLab repository by [url="clicking here"]https://gitlab.com/composr-foundation/composr[/url]. Version 11 is on the v11 branch.

We often commit fixes to Git before patch releases come out. Consider the Git repository "bleeding-edge" which means it is unstable, liable to bugs, and not as strictly tested as official releases. Be aware that the Git repository also has many non-bundled addons in it. We develop them in there to keep them up-to-date. There is a script called [tt]delete_alien_files.php[/tt] which will erase them. You need to first delete the [tt]sources_custom/hooks/systems/addon_registry/*.php[/tt] files of any addons you don't want, then run the script, then run the commands the script says (after reviewing), then install.

We accept and encourage external contributions via [url="merge requests"]https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html[/url] to the repository. Please [page=":contact"]Contact Us[/page] (under Free services > Make a partnership enquiry) after making a merge request if you would like to be listed as a developer or receive points for your contributions. We also encourage the submission of addons via our [page=":addon_submission"]Addon submission guidelines[/page].

[title="2"]Requirements[/title]

We recommend the following criteria for an optimal install of Composr CMS:

 - Apache or IIS webserver
  - Composr CMS may also work with NGINX or LiteSpeed with special considerations and configuration; it is not supported
 - PHP 7.2 or above (ideally do not use any end-of-life versions)
  - Memory limit set to 128 MB or above
  - No disallowed_functions, max_input_vars
  - Max execution time of 30 - 300 seconds (make sure no downstream software will affect this such as NGINX or Cloudflare)
  - A cache enabled such as opCache
  - The following extensions enabled:
   - Ctype
   - cURL
   - GD2
   - Gettext
   - Hash
   - Intl
   - Json
   - Posix
   - Sodium (if you enable anonymous sending of errors or telemetry to composr.app)
   - Unicode
   - ZipArchive
   - XML
   - zlib
   - OpenSSL
   - mysqli or pdo_mysql (if using MySQL or MariaDB)
 - MySQL 5.5.3 or higher (tested up to 8.2), or MariaDB 10 (tested up to 10.6)
  - You could also use PostgreSQL or a flat-file XML database, but these are not regularly tested or supported
 - 250 MB free storage space at minimum
 - a suEXEC-like filesystem (unless you are okay with using chmod)
 - turn ModSecurity off, or set it to detection only (Composr has its own built-in Web Application Firewall, and ModSecurity will interfere with Composr's functionality)
