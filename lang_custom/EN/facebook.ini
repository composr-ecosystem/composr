CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_uid=Optional. The Facebook page ID (a number) where syndicated content goes to, and associated to the site via Open Graph.

Note that posts to the page will be shown as being from this Facebook account too. If you prefer, you can enter a group ID (for syndicating to a group's wall) into this setting, which will work too, assuming again that you are logged in appropriately on Facebook's end. If left blank no Facebook syndication will happen.
