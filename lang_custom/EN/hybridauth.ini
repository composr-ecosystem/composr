HYBRIDAUTH=Hybridauth
DOC_HYBRIDAUTH=Hybridauth is a third-party library allowing you to set up member syndication between popular websites and your own site. This means members can join or log in to your site by using their accounts on other sites you configure (without your site knowing the credentials of their other accounts). This is advanced functionality and generally requires that you create developer accounts / get API keys from the platforms you wish to link.
