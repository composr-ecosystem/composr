Note that not all errors are reported (such as ones dealing with custom code, non-bundled addons, critical errors when Composr dies out in a critical state, or server misconfigurations). If you notice a pattern where a certain error is getting reported multiple times by multiple websites, you should create a tracker issue for it (but do not include any sensitive server info which may be included in the error messages below). Once you have 'handled' a record, mark it off under <kbd>Actions</kbd>. Or, use the button at the bottom to mass-resolve and auto-resolve current and future errors based on a search string.

HOSTING_COPY=Copy installer to webhosting
HOSTING_COPY_SUCCESS=The installer has successfully been copied. Now you must launch the install.php script to proceed through it. The installer will ask you for some details, including those for a MySQL database you should create, and FTP details.
HOSTING_INTRO=This tool will copy the software to the webhosting location you specify. You need to know FTP details to use this system, which were either given to you or need setting-up via your webhosting control panel.
HOSTING_FILE_GONE_MISSING=Your server did not return an error when uploading the file, but the file appears to gone have missing from your server.

DESCRIPTION_BASE_URL=The URL to the base of your installation (e.g. http://example.com/portal).
CMS_COPYWAIT=Copying may take a few minutes. Please be patient. We assume that your FTP server runs on the standard port 21, and unfortunately cannot support FTP-SSL or SFTP.
DESCRIPTION_PRIVACY_CMS_SITES_INSTALLED=Handle data pertaining to your site's installation status, relayed error notifications, and, if you provided it, your e-mail for newsletters.

RELAYED_ERROR=Relayed error #{1}
DESCRIPTION_RELAYED_ERROR=<p>Your error was relayed to the core developers. Here, you can check the status of the relayed error (the information provided pertains only to your site). This page is intentionally kept vague for security as these pages are public.</p> <p>Note that a relayed error does not guarantee it will be fixed; you should still report it on the {1} if you have not done so already (if you believe this is an actual software bug).</p> <p>Please contact us if you wish for us to purge your relayed errors from our database.</p>

DESCRIPTION_TELEMETRY_IGNORE_STRING=The string which, when contained in any relayed error messages (present or future), will be marked auto-resolved with the optional provided note.
TELEMETRY_IGNORE_TEXT=<p>On this page, you can define a list of ignore cases for relayed error messages. When you add an ignore case, all present relayed errors matching the search string will auto-resolve with the optionally provided note. And all future relayed errors will also likewise auto-resolve.</p><p>Consider adding common errors to the errorservice.csv file opposed to adding an ignore case here; any errors which match something on the CSV file will automatically be resolved and the error service text included in the note.</p>
TELEMETRY_IGNORE_NOTE=Resolve note
DESCRIPTION_TELEMETRY_IGNORE_NOTE=The notes which will apply to any relayed error containing the search string (and webmasters can see). Do not include sensitive information; this is technically publicly visible.

ARE_YOU_SURE_DELETE_IGNORE_ERROR=Are you sure you want to delete the search string <kbd>{1}</kbd> for auto-resolving relayed errors?
MISSING_RESOURCE__TELEMETRY=The requested relayed error does not exist. It may never have existed, the GUID is wrong, or it was deleted. Please <strong>do not</strong> refresh the page; repeatedly trying to access missing relayed errors may trigger a ban.

This will typically last until proactive mitigation has been taken.</li><li><strong>Analysis:</strong> We will analyse and investigate the scope and severity of the data breach including identifying unauthorised access or use of personal information.</li><li><strong>Proactive Mitigation:</strong> Once we have a clear picture of what happened, we will take proactive mitigation as we deem fit. This could include resetting member passwords, banning rogue members and IP addresses, reverting changes or applying patches to software or services, rolling back the site to a stable backup / checkpoint, and/or reporting the breach to law enforcement authorities for additional investigation and prosecution.</li><li><strong>Communication:</strong> Once the above steps have been finished, we will communicate the data breach to all members of {1} via e-mail (except those who explicitly un-subscribed from e-mails) and via a news article on the site. We will explain what happened, what areas and data were affected, what {1} has done to mitigate the breach and prevent it in the future, and what members should do to protect themselves.</li></ol>
