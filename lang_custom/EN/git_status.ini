GIT_STATUS=Git status
GIT_LIVE_BRANCH=Git live branch
CONFIG_OPTION_git_live_branch=The live branch for Git. You will not be able to push any changes through the Git status module if Git is not on that branch, as the assumption will be that you're on a branch of programming changes, not of content management changes. Leave blank for no restriction.
