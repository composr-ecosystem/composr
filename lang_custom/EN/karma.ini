KARMIC_INFLUENCE=Karmic Influence
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_KARMIC_INFLUENCE=These options allow you to configure how much influence an individual member can have on other members' karma (if they have the &ldquo;Can influence the karma of other members&rdquo; privilege).<br /><br />Changes to these settings will not retroactively apply to karma which members already received.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_USE_VOTING_POWER=Use voting power for karmic influence
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_use_voting_power=If enabled, the amount of karmic influence members have will be equal to their voting power (regardless whether or not voting power is enabled for polls), and thus all other options for karmic influence (except &ldquo;Additional influence&rdquo; &ldquo;Influence penalty for warnings (days)&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Influence multiplier&rdquo;) will be ignored.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_ACCOUNT_AGE=Account age (days)
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_account_age=Members will have 1 point of karmic influence for every specified number of days old their account is. Set to 0 to disable this criteria. This option is ignored if &ldquo;Use voting power for karmic influence&rdquo; is enabled.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_FORUM_POSTS=Forum posts
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_forum_posts=Members will have 1 point of karmic influence for every specified number of forum posts they made. Set to 0 to disable this criteria. This option is ignored if &ldquo;Use voting power for karmic influence&rdquo; is enabled.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_LIFETIME_POINTS=Life-time Points
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_lifetime_points=Members will have 1 point of karmic influence for every specified number of life-time points they ever earned. Set to 0 to disable this criteria. This option is ignored if &ldquo;Use voting power for karmic influence&rdquo; is enabled.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_POINTS=Points balance
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_points=Members will have 1 point of karmic influence for every specified number of points currently in their balance. Set to 0 to disable this criteria. This option is ignored if &ldquo;Use voting power for karmic influence&rdquo; is enabled.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_KARMA=Karma
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_karma=Members will have 1 point of karmic influence for every specified amount of karma (good - bad) they have. For example, if this is set to 100 and a member has 400 good karma and 100 bad karma, they will have 3 karmic influence points ((400 - 100) / 100). Set to '0' to disable this criteria. This option is ignored if &ldquo;Use voting power for karmic influence&rdquo; is enabled.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_ADDITIONAL=Additional influence
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_additional=Those with the &ldquo;Has additional karmic influence&rdquo; privilege will be given this much additional karmic influence. This privilege might be useful for usergroups representing vetted members / staff of the site.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_WARNINGS=Influence penalty for warnings (days)
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_warnings=For every formal warning a member was issued in the last specified number of days, karmic influence will be subtracted as configured under <kbd>Influence penalty for warnings (amount)</kbd> (it will never go below 0). Set to '0' to disable this behaviour.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_WARNINGS_AMOUNT=Influence penalty for warnings (amount)
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_warnings_amount=The amount of karmic influence to penalise for every formal warning issued to a member within the configured number of days under <kbd>Influence penalty for warnings (days)</kbd>. Decimals are allowed. Set to '0' to disable this behaviour.
KARMA_INFLUENCE_MULTIPLIER=Influence multiplier
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_influence_multiplier=After performing all other calculations, the member's karmic influence will be multiplied by this value. This could be useful when using &ldquo;Use voting power for karmic influence&rdquo; and voting powers could climb really high. For example, you can specify 0.25 to divide the influence by 4.
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_KARMA=These options allow you to configure karma options and how much karma members receive for certain actions.<br /><br />Multiplier values are represented as a multiplier of a member's karmic influence. For example, if you specify 2 for 5-star ratings and the member who provided the 5-star rating had a karmic influence of 3, then the member receiving the 5-star rating will earn 6 good karma (2 * 3). Specify '0' to disable karma for that action.<br /><br />Changes to these settings will not retroactively apply to karma which members already received.
KARMA_AWARDS=Karma for Awards
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_awards=For each time a member is given a top content award, they will receive the specified amount of good karma. Note that karma is not automatically removed when the award is removed or edited / reassigned; you will need to do this manually in Admin Zone > Audit > Karma.
KARMA_LIKES=Karmic Influence Multiplier: Likes / high ratings
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_likes=For each time a member is given a like or a 5-star rating, they will receive good karma equal to the rating member's karmic influence multiplied by this value. The member will receive 1/2 that value in good karma for a 4-star rating. Set to '0' to disable earning good karma for likes / good ratings.
KARMA_DISLIKES=Karmic Influence Multiplier: Dislikes / low ratings
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_dislikes=For each time a member is given a dislike or a 1-star rating, they will receive bad karma equal to the rating member's karmic influence multiplied by this value. Set to '0' to disable earning bad karma for dislikes / bad ratings.
KARMA_POINTS=Karma for Points Received from Members
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_points=When a member sends another member points (excluding escrows), the recipient will receive good karma equal to the sender's karmic influence for every specified number of points that were sent. For example, if this was set to 25, and a member with a karmic influence of 2 sent 75 points, the recipient would get 6 good karma ((75 / 25) * 2). Set to '0' to disable earning good karma for receiving points from other members. Set to a negative multiplier (such as '-1') to always give (absolute value of the number * karmic influence) good karma to the receipient regardless of the number of points sent (for example, -5 means when a member with 2 karmic influence sends points to another member, regardless of the number of points they sent, the receiving member will get (Abs(-5) * 2) 10 good karma).
KARMA_POINTS_IDOLISR=Points karma only for Idolisr role
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_points_idolisr=Only award good karma for points received from another member if the sender specified a role for the points (Idolisr).
KARMA_VOTING=Voting karma
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_voting=The amount of good karma that will be awarded to a member each time they vote in a topic or website poll. Note that you must have the scheduler set up, and that karma will not be reversed automatically if votes are removed / revoked.
KARMA_GIFTR=Giftr multiplier
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_giftr=For each time a member receives a virtual gift from another member (giftr), they will receive good karma equal to the sender's karmic influence multiplied by this value. Set to '0' to disable earning good karma for virtual gifts. Note that you must have the scheduler set up, and that karma will not be reversed automatically if gifts are removed.
KARMA_MEMBER_COMMENTS=Member comments multiplier
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_member_comments=For each time a member receives a comment on their profile, they will receive good karma equal to the commenter's karmic influence multiplied by this value. Set to '0' to disable earning good karma for member comments.
KARMA_ECOMMERCE=eCommerce purchases karma
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_ecommerce=When a member purchases something, they will receive 1 good karma for every specified amount of currency they spent. If they instead spent points, the &ldquo;Points per unit of currency&rdquo; option will be used to convert the amount spent to currency to determine how much good karma to award. Set to '0' to disable earning good karma for purchases.
KARMA_THRESHOLD=Karma bar threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_karma_threshold=The karma bar for every member will be filled completely once their karma exceeds this amount (for those who can view bad karma, we take the maximum of either good or bad karma). Set to '0' for the bar to always be completely filled (useful if you have &ldquo;View good and bad karma values separately&rdquo; privilege set for everyone and you just want to display the ratio of good to bad karma)
