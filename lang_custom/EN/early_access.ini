EARLY_ACCESS_CODES_TEXT=<p>You can create and manage early access codes and triggers. These allow you to share early access to content which is not yet validated.</p><p>To use an early access code, simply add it as a URL parameter; for example, to use the 'foobar' code, put <kbd>keep_access_code=foobar</kbd> in the URL (e.g. <kbd>yourbaseurl/home.htm?keep_access_code=foobar</kbd> or <kbd>yourbaseurl/index.php?page=home&keep_access_code=foobar</kbd>). You will get an explicit example / link when adding or editing a code.</p>

NUM_VIEWS_ALLOWED=Maximum views
TRIGGER_ACCESS=Trigger access tag

DESCRIPTION_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE=This is the access code which will be used to access this content. If you want to define your own access code, type it here. It must be alphanumeric and must not already exist. If you leave this blank, one will be generated randomly for you. This cannot be edited once set.
DESCRIPTION_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_LABEL=A concise descriptive label for this code. This will be used when adding new content if you want to select an access code in which to add the new content.
EARLY_ACCESS_TRIGGER_ACCESS=Trigger access tag
DESCRIPTION_EARLY_ACCESS_TRIGGER_ACCESS=A trigger access tag is a tag that can be used with the <kbd>$HAS_TRIGGER_ACCESS</kbd> Tempcode symbol. This defines some template content which will only be viewable if the access code has been defined. For example, if access code '123abc' has a tag of 'foobar', then any Tempcode within a <kbd>$HAS_TRIGGER_ACCESS</kbd> symbol with the tag of 'foobar' will only be visible if the visitor has the access code 'abc123' in the URL. You can apply the same tag to multiple access codes, but not the other way around.
DESCRIPTION_EARLY_ACCESS_FROM=The date and time at which this access code begins to work. Leave blank for immediately. Specify in the time zone which you have set on your account.
DESCRIPTION_EARLY_ACCESS_TO=The date and time at which this access code expires. Leave blank for no expiration. Specify in the time zone which you have set on your account.
DESCRIPTION_NUM_VIEWS_ALLOWED=The maximum number of hits allowed with this access code. A hit is registered every time someone using the access code views a piece of content which was restricted to the access code. Leave blank for no limit.
DESCRIPTION_EARLY_ACCESS_CONTENT=Choose the content which has not been validated you wish to attach to this access code. Anyone using the access code can access this content despite it not being validated.

ACCESS_CODE_NOT_ALLOWED=The access code <kbd>{1}</kbd> is not allowed.
ACCESS_CODE_IN_USE=The access code <kbd>{1}</kbd> is already in use.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_EXPIRED__VIEWS=No more views are allowed with this early access code (only {1} {1|view|views} were allowed).
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_EXPIRED__TOO_EARLY=This early access code is not yet active; it will be active {1}.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_EXPIRED__TOO_LATE=This access code expired {1}.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_IN_USE=You are using an early access code to get a peak at our content.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_VIEWS_LEFT=This code has been used to see early-access content {1} out of {2} allowed {2|time|times}.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_EXPIRES=This code expires {1}.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_USE=To use this early access code, you will want to tack on a <kbd>keep_access_code={2}</kbd> URL parameter. For example, {1}. The access code will remain attached to the URL so long as you use navigation and links directly on the site.
EARLY_ACCESS_CODE_USE_HYPERLINK=this link contains a URL to home with the access code attached
INVALID_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE=The access code you are providing in the URL does not exist.

ADD_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE=Add an early access code
EDIT_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE=Edit an early access code
EDIT_THIS_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE=Edit this early access code
DELETE_EARLY_ACCESS_CODE=Delete an early access code
