[title sub="Written by Chris Graham"]Composr Tutorial: Anti-spam settings[/title]

Attack by spam-bots can be a major problem for a website. Fortunately Composr provides a number of tools to help you.

This tutorial will go through the tools available, and our philosophy regarding them.
The actual configuration options are under Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Security options, and should be reasonably intuitive.

This tutorial does not cover validation, which is covered in the [page="_SEARCH:tut_censor"]Dealing with annoying users[/page] tutorial.

[title="2"]CAPTCHA[/title]

[media width="150" description="The CAPTCHA" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_antispam/captcha.png[/media]
CAPTCHA is the conventional tool to stop guest actions (such as joining, or posting) without first proving you're human. It can also be configured for new members.

Composr uses a couple unique methods to generate the CAPTCHA which have proven very effective against automated bots and Artificial Intelligence:
[list]
[*][b]CSS[/b]
When enabled, instead of an actual image, Composr renders the CAPTCHA pixel by pixel using inline CSS. This makes extracting the image through automated means much harder to do.
[*][b]JavaScript[/b]
When enabled, the CAPTCHA is loaded in an iframe using an AJAX request. This makes it harder for harvesters and spammers using agents that do not run JavaScript to get the CAPTCHA (as the CAPTCHA will never load without JavaScript making the AJAX call).
[*][b]NATO phrases in the audio CAPTCHA[/b]
We added NATO alphabet phrases in the audio version of the CAPTCHA to throw off speech-to-text converters and Artificial Intelligence. These phrases are often transcribed, making it harder to process an audio CAPTCHA by automated means. But humans are usually smart enough to ignore these phrases (in fact, the phrases can help you determine the letters and numbers more, especially if distortion is enabled).
[/list]

Composr also enables by default the ability to provide distortion on CAPTCHAs. When enabled, image CAPTCHAs will have random lines and pixels to make reading the characters harder. And Audio CAPTCHAs will have audio distortion to make understanding the speech harder. It is highly recommended to leave this enabled; disabling will significantly increase the chance automated bots or Artificial Intelligence can understand the CAPTCHA.

Generally-speaking, CAPTCHA will protect you from most spam. The exception tends to be when real humans do set up accounts and spam using them. Some spammers also subcontract CAPTCHA solutions to humans on low-salaries. Other spammers serve target site's CAPTCHAs out to video sites (for example) where viewers unwittingly are made to solve them in order to be allowed to watch a video. And in rare cases, a spammer might set up a sophisticated means to screenshot the CAPTCHA and send it into Artificial Intelligence for analysis (but as of this writing, we found even AI gets our CAPTCHAs wrong quite often).

Alternative CAPTCHA systems, such as solving maths problems, or recognising cats, or answering domain-problems (i.e. something specific about the subject of the website the CAPTCHA is on), are very popular. However this is purely "security through obscurity". A spammer can easily target a specific site's collection of answers, then spam that site enormously -- because unlike the regular CAPTCHAs, these CAPTCHAs work on a much more limited set of problems and solutions. That said, they can work for smaller sites -- and we do offer this functionality.

Note that letters are always capitalised in the image (but the input field is case insensitive). Additionally, CAPTCHAs will never use zero and O, nor one and L, because these characters look much too similar with each other.

CAPTCHAs are also generated with cryptographic randomness to make it hard to predict.

Composr's default CAPTCHA tries to be both highly secure, and reasonable for a human to use, and then we have additional protections too.

The default 'CSS' CAPTCHA might not render well on web browsers using a zoom. For this reason, and to provide additional accessibility, a CAPTCHA can be clicked to open it as a larger 'image' in a new tab.

We have an audio option for the CAPTCHA which is important for users with visual impairments (but this is easier to solve by spammers, so be careful).

[title="2"]Public block lists[/title]

[title="3"]Remote Block Lists (RBLs)[/title]

Remote Block Lists (RBLs) are a technique whereby Composr checks third-party lists of known spammers, via special RBL-protocols, based on DNS. You don't need to know the technical details other than that Composr can be configured to use an RBL service.

[s]{$IS_MAINTAINED,rbl,We have picked defaults options} within Composr to help you get started with the best service(s).[/s] Update: Actually the default list is now empty, as we learnt that there currently aren't any very reliable services for this. Common ones may block too widely, for example blocking computers that were at any point in the last year infected with a virus.

[title="3"]{$IS_MAINTAINED,stop_forum_spam,Stop Forum Spam}[/title]

We use the popular [url="Stop Forum Spam system"]https://www.stopforumspam.com/[/url] system to look for known spammers based upon IP address, username, and e-mail address. We also report who you identify as spammers, back to Stop Forum Spam.

[title="3"]Options[/title]

[media width="150" description="The options" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_antispam/settings.png[/media]
The options are located at Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Security options > Spammer detection.

You can configure when spam checks are performed via the "Spammer checking level" configuration option:
 - Every page view (performs RBL checks always, and full check on actions)
 - Actions (joining, posting, trackbacks)
 - Guest actions (joining, Guest posting, trackbacks)
 - Joining
 - Never

Some anti-spam services (RBLs, Stop Forum Spam) will provide a 'confidence level' (out of 100) for whether they think an IP address is a spammer. Services that simply return yes/no will be given the value of the 'Implied spammer confidence' option as the confidence level if they say yes.

The confidence level is then compared about a number of configured thresholds:
 - Approval (the staff will have to validate a content submission, even if privileges normally say it would go through immediately)
 - Block (the attempted action will be blocked)
 - Ban (the user's IP address will be banned for the configured Block list cache time)

Other options include:
 - Specifying how long spam results are cached for
 - Specifying how long to trust reports of a spammer that were assigned a "last spam activity" date
 - Many options for determining the confidence level internally based on various heuristics

[title="2"]Link posting[/title]

Absence of the "Post links that search engines will follow" privilege disincentivises users from posting links. Without this privilege all links will have [tt]rel="nofollow"[/tt].

[title="3"]Links on member profiles[/title]

We entirely block the presence of links on Composr member profiles for members with no posts. The links will automatically reappear once a member has a post, and disappear again if their post(s) are deleted. If the [tt]cns_forum[/tt] addon is not installed then this functionality is not active.
This is to disincentivise spammers from flagging your site as an easy way to get links that won't even get moderated away.

[title="2"]Black hole[/title]

[media width="150" description="The black hole in a form's HTML" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_antispam/blackhole.png[/media]
Composr forms can include a 'black hole' which is a specially hidden field that should not filled in, but spambots are likely to fill in by accident (because they don't have the same sense for 'hidden' that a human does). If a spammer fills in the black hole field then they will be marked as spammers.

[title="2"]Project Honey Pot[/title]

We integrate the Project Honey Pot service, for injection of a hidden Honey Pot link onto pages. Spambots following the link will flag as spammers in the Project Honey Pot system. This feeds the HTTP:BL block list, which is one of the RBL services Composr can use.
You need to specifically configure the options for Honey Pot -- it requires you to sign up for their service, and fill in some special configuration options.

[title="2"]Reported content/posts[/title]

If someone spams then they can use the 'report content'/'report post' feature to alert the staff to the spammer activity.
This is described in the [page="_SEARCH:tut_censor"]Dealing with annoying users[/page] tutorial.

[title="2"]Guest posting[/title]

You may simply want to deny some guest permissions, which will raise the effort spammers have to go to:
 - Guest posting permissions on the forum
 - The "Comment upon content" privilege (Admin Zone > Security > Privileges > Feedback)
 - The "May report posts" privilege (Admin Zone > Security > Privileges > General settings)
 - Anonymous posts: the "Anonymous posts within private topics" configuration option (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Forum options > Private Topics), and the option individually on forums

This may be enough to deter them.

You may want to also disable permission for Guests to report content.

[title="2"]Per-site Q&A / Probation / Shadow-banning (advanced)[/title]

There is a developer addon, [tt]antispam_question[/tt], which checks the value of a Custom Profile Field to see if it matches a pre-defined setting. If it does not, it puts the member in the Probation usergroup only.

You could then configure your forum permissions so there is only a single forum these members see, that normal members don't. This effectively works as a shadow-ban. You can then move people out of Probation manually if you need to.

The developer addon hard-codes the CPF ID being checked against, and the expected value, and the ID of the usergroup to put failing members in (the default Probation usergroup). It would be fairly easy to customise with minimal coding skills, although ideally we'd add a [url="more extensive configurable feature"]https://composr.app/tracker/view.php?id=1579[/url].

[title="2"]Setting rules[/title]

If spam is being posted by real humans, those humans may not realise you have [tt]nofollow[/tt], and other measures that minimise the effectiveness of their spam.
It may be a good idea to explicitly mention your policies on your join page so that human spammers will know they are wasting their time, and thus avoid wasting your time too. The composr.app site has a good example you can follow (in the [page="_SEARCH:rules"]rules[/page]).

[title="2"]What we don't do[/title]

[media thumb="0" framed="0" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/dont.png[/media]
We're not a fan of all anti-spam systems. Here's a run-down of what we don't do:
 - Some popular spam checking tools will run checks through a commercial third-party server. We'd rather deliver our code to you within Composr, for improved performance, reliability, and in line with our Open Source philosophy (e.g. third party services often sell or use your data).
 - Various alternative CAPTCHA systems (as explained above, under 'CAPTCHA')

[title="2"]Making a spam report to the developers[/title]

It is possible that occasionally a spammer may get through Composr's options. If so, please make a thorough report via the Contact Us page on {$BRAND_BASE_URL}  (choose "Report a spam attack on my Composr site") -- so that we have the chance to properly look into how it got through.

Include:
[list="a"]
[*] What exact anti-spam options are configured
[*] Where the spammer is getting through (e.g. making a forum post)
[*] The spammer's IP address
[*] The spammer's user-agent
[*] The time of the incident
[*] Whether the spam was by a guest (and if so, if you have guest posting permissions configured)
[*] An audit trail of pages the spammer went through (to help us identify if it is a bot) (Go to Admin Zone > Security > Members > Investigate user)
[*] What is on the spammers member profile (if applicable)
[/list]

Avoid being anecdotal or emotional -- give clear and concise facts.

Once you've made your report hopefully someone can then tell you what case category you are in:
[list="a"]
[*] Incorrect or weak Composr security set up -- in which case someone may be able to advise
[*] Manual spammer attack
[*] Insufficient protection within Composr -- in which case we can consider making Composr improvements
[/list]

[title="2"]Cleaning up after a forum spammer[/title]

The warn/punish form has a spammer mode that allows 1-click disposal of a spammer account, via providing some good default settings on the form. The default settings will delete all their forum posts and topics, and ban/report them in various ways. You can always tune the exact settings each time you action the form but the defaults are usually what you'd want.

There are two ways to open the spammer mode:
 - The "Deal with as spammer" Audit action from their member profile screen
 - By clicking 'Warn' button under a forum post using the middle mouse button (if you have one)

[title="2"]Additional future techniques[/title]

Fighting spam is an ongoing challenge. Actual humans are paid to post spam, and increasingly will try and hide spam behind legitimate activity. Ideas for fighting spammer are categorised under the [url="Type: Spam"]https://composr.app/tracker/tag_view_page.php?tag_id=52[/url] tracker tag.
