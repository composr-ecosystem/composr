This section covers coding standards that should be upheld, but are either:
1) relate to a very specific Composr scenario that most developers won't be facing day-to-day
2) so obvious you don't need to learn them in advance either

It serves as a reference guide for settling disagreements, as a general reference when doing more extensive quality reviews, and a reference for what some of our automated tests do.

[color="red"]Any page should be accessible as standalone[/color]
| Usability
| All development
| Manually
| You shouldn't add modules that are never intended to be used independently, because they will come up on the sitemap. If you intend to write some kind of helper script that may be called by a module then either use an "entry-point script" for that or build the functionality into the module file itself (you are allowed to [tt]exit[/tt] out of a module with your own HTTP headers etc rather than returning Tempcode).

[color="red"]Write appropriate hooks etc for new content types[/color]
| Consistency
| Composr development +
| Manually
| When adding new content types remember to write all appropriate hooks for them (e.g. search hooks). And implement standard systems like SEO metadata, feedback systems, validation, and permissions.

| Usability
| Product development only
| Manually
| Show the appropriate maximum-upload size on all screens that support file uploads, unless the size is very unlikely to be reached by the user (e.g. just uploading an avatar). Composr has a standard mechanism to do this, which can be automated within CRUD modules. For code examples search the code for [tt]get_upload_limit_config_url[/tt].

Don't define too many functions in a single file

Define log file in a hook
| GDPR, Administration
| Composr development
| Manually
| A [tt]systems/logs[/tt] hook needs to define that your log exists. This allows the log purger to clear out old records, and the administrative error-log interface to find your log.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Use correct date format
| GDPR
| Composr development
| Manually
| Start your log entries using the output of [tt]loggable_date()[/tt]. This consistent date formatting will allow the log purger to read the log. Multiple lines per entry and lead-in text at the top of the log are allowed; these special lines should not include the date/time. Other than this function there's no explicit log-writing API, because it's pretty standard PHP file I/O.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Lock your file when writing
| Stability
| Composr development
| Manually
| Multiple processes may want to write to the log at the same time. Look how other logging code handles locking. In rare situations it may be guaranteed an operation is not going to happen concurrently, in which case you can forget about locking.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Store log as [tt]data_custom/whatever.log[/tt]
| Security
| Composr development
| Manually
| This allows the default Apache [tt].htaccess[/tt] to deny web access to the log. The only exception should be logs which are created by default, which must be [tt].php[/tt] files with some lead-in code to prevent PHP command execution (using [tt].php[/tt] is the only 100%-reliable way to prevent unintended file download by URL access).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Do not create log by default
| Security
| Composr development
| Manually
| Logs should usually only be used if the standard file has been pre-created by hand. This avoids bloated unneeded logs that may not be properly secured against unwanted access. See the note above for stipulations around the exception to this rule.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Reference in [tt]web.config[/tt] file
| Security
| Composr development
| Manually
| We support IIS, which does not support wild-card blocking of file access. So we must manually block access to each individual log file.

[color="red"]Don't append to URLs in templates[/color]
| URL schemes
| All development
| Manually
| Do not try and appending something to a URL inside a template, unless it is a URL to a helper script (rather than a screen) or if you have explicitly disabled SEO for the URL. URL schemes involve different URL structures. Pass in all the URLs you need to the template so you don't need to deploy hacks.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Don't assume directories already exist to write into[/color]
| Shared installs: multiple sites with one Composr install, GAE
| Product development only
| Manually
| If running a blank custom directory, none of the bundled directory structure will be initially present. You must therefore detect and auto-create missing directories, using [tt]make_missing_directory[/tt].

|-

[color="red"]Don't require write queries on normal page views[/color]
| Stability, Performance
| Product development only
| Manually
| Some webhosts will restrict SQL write permission if a database size limit is exceeded, so any routine write queries should have the [tt]$fail_ok[/tt] option set so that it doesn't take the whole site down.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Do maintenance using [tt]cms_register_shutdown_function_safe[/tt][/color]
| Performance
| Product development only
| Manually
| Non-critical maintenance such as logging, updating view counts, or deleting expired records, should be done at script end and using the [tt]cms_register_shutdown_function_safe[/tt] function. This is to decrease the time before rendering the page output. Note that we use the [tt]cms_register_shutdown_function_safe[/tt] instead of the [tt]register_shutdown_function[/tt] function, as a minority of servers do not support [tt]register_shutdown_function[/tt].
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use [tt]statistical_update_model[/tt] function for controlling view count maintenance, and increment directly[/color]
| Performance
| Product development only
| Manually
| The [tt]statistical_update_model[/tt] function does a number of checks to see if and how view counts should change. Use this function in the same pattern as it is used elsewhere in the code. Do not increment by explicitly passing in a new view count, as that would assume the view count hasn't changed since it came out of the database -- run a query to directly increment from the in-database field.

[color="red"]Object orientated principles[/color]
| Technical debt
| Product development only
| 
| Use object-orientated principles properly where Composr does already. For example, forum drivers all have a database object as a property, rather than referencing the global [tt]FORUM_DB[/tt] object. This is because they provide a core service and cannot make assumptions about the environment (e.g. it must be possible to have multiple simultaneous forum drivers running).

[color="red"]Remember posted Comcode might be invalid[/color]
| Stability
| All development
| Manually
| If you are supporting Composr attachments in a field, run the [tt]check_comcode[/tt] function on the Comcode that references the attachments before the main row for the content is added to the database. This ensures the Comcode is valid, so you can proceed to add the content row (using the integer [tt]0[/tt] temporarily as the field value for where the Comcode will be placed). The attachment Comcode can then be fully parsed (given the ID of the content row, so it can store its security properly) and then the content row updated with the new content language string ID for that parsed Comcode.

|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Don't use [tt]require_javascript[/tt] or [tt]require_css[/tt]
| Stability: cache safety
| All development
| Manually
| When implementing tags, CSS must all be in [tt]global.css[/tt], and any JavaScript must be by using a symbol to load the JavaScript file -- this is because any inclusion code put in the PHP rendering code only runs when the Comcode is first compiled, and not when it is loaded out of the cache.

| Make sure that modules upgrade properly between major versions of Composr, and preferably between all versions. Do not assume a module will never be upgraded: if your module has undergone database structure revisions then you must make sure there is upgrade code to apply these revisions. See how existing code does it for examples.

When quoting single words or terms use single quotes, which in language files and templates would generally be done using the HTML lsquo and rsquo entities.
When quoting something code-related like a language keyword use Comcode's [tt]tt[/tt] or HTML's [tt]kbd[/tt].
When referencing keyboard key names, refer to them like Ctrl or Shift or Option or Alt: capitalise the first letter.
When in general trying to draw attention to a word/term/phrase that isn't part of any quotation, use bold.
