[title sub="Written by Jean Gosselin"]Composr Supplementary: Making a new theme[/title]

This document presents an illustrated step-by-step tutorial on making a new theme.

This tutorial was written for version 8, so specific CSS changes are no longer accurate. It therefore cannot be followed exactly anymore.
However it is still very useful to see the exact steps taken to make a theme, start to finish.

[title="2"]How to copy and adjust an existing theme[/title]

Continuing on with the Paradise theme, we can make a new theme Jungle, by just copying it. This is useful if you like an existing Composr theme and want to modify it without making the changes directly on top of the original theme.
