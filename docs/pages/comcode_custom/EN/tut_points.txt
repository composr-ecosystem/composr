[title="2"]Points Introduction[/title]

The [concept]Points[/concept] addon allows webmasters to provide a sophisticated virtual economy and rewards system for their members in Composr. Members can earn points through various actions on the website. Then, they can spend those points on site products, services, or account upgrades... or they can send them to other members for appreciation or payment for goods and services.

[title="2"]Earning points[/title]

There are many ways to earn points in Composr. You may not wish to tell your members the precise details for these, in order to avoid abuse and unbalanced member activity, although of course they could educate themselves by reading this tutorial.

Methods of earning points include:
 - Joining
 - Voting in a poll
 - Rating content
 - Poll chosen
 - Submitting various forms of content
 - Length of membership
 - Visiting the site
 - Posting on the forum
 - Entering/passing quizzes
 - Receiving them (this is described in a later section)
 - Earning them from selling a download (this is described in a later section)
 - Birthdays

Most methods of earning points may be altered in the configuration (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Points options), so that the number of points earned from various activities is appropriate for your website.

There is a distinction between the point count for points available for spending, and the point count for the total points ever earned (which contributes to rank and leader-board position). This will usually be made clear, but sometimes circumstance will dictate what is the appropriate meaning.

[title="3"]A note about birthday points[/title]

If birthday points is set to greater than 0, then members and staff cannot edit their own birthdays once they set it. This is to prevent birthday point abuse. Members should contact a staff member if they made a mistake in their birthday.

[title="2"]Sending points[/title]

[media width="150" description="Those who send points may get randomly rewarded by the system if gift points is enabled (this encourages an active community)" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_lucky.png[/media]
[concept]Point-sending[/concept] allows members to reward each other.
[concept]Points escrow[/concept] allows members to exchange points for some form of written agreement (which can relate to an outside purchase or service as an example). Like money can be used to pay someone, so can points, based on whatever they value. This economical situation is very important, and essentially capitalism is embodied, such that people go hunting for work that is valued most highly in order to get high returns of points. Furthermore, since points are held escrow in the system until both parties confirm the written agreement has been met, this ensures trust in the points exchange. Should an issue arise, one of the members can dispute the escrow, and someone with the &ldquo;Moderate points escrowed&rdquo; privilege can review it.

Some reasons someone might send points include:
 - Payment for a product or service provided (usually via points escrow)
 - A prize for winning a competition
 - A sign of appreciation for producing a high quality product or piece of content that benefits the community

To send or escrow points to another member, visit their profile and go in their points tab. There will be a form to send points and a separate form to escrow points. Members must have the &ldquo;Send points to other members&rdquo; privilege to send points to other members, and they must have the &ldquo;Escrow points to others&rdquo; privilege to hold points in escrow for another member. The member being sent or escrowed points must also have the &ldquo;Use points&rdquo; privilege to be sent or escrowed points.

Members may not send points to themselves unless they have the &ldquo;Send points to self&rdquo; privilege.

[title="3"]Gift points (advanced)[/title]

By default, members have a single point balance that they can use both to spend on things and to send to other members (if they have the &ldquo;Send points to other members&rdquo; privilege). However, website administrators can enable a separate gift points balance by ticking (checking) the &ldquo;Enable gift points&rdquo; configuration option (under Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Points options > Point transactions).

[concept]Gift points[/concept] (when enabled) are a separate point balance allowing members to send points without affecting their regular points balance. Gift points cannot be spent on anything; they can only be sent to others. Gift points become regular spendable points for recipients when they are sent. Members receive a configurable amount of gift points per day that they can send to others based on which usergroups they are in. When a member tries to send more points than they have in gift points, the remainder will be deducted from their regular points balance. Confirmation screens ensure the member understands how their points will be distributed.

For example, member A has 100 points and 25 gift points. They can spend their 100 points on things, but they cannot spend their 25 gift points. Member A wants to give Member B 50 points. Since member A only has 25 gift points, the other 25 points will be deducted from their regular points. Therefore, after the transaction, member A will have 75 regular points and 0 gift points. And member B will receive 50 regular points which they can spend.

When gift points are enabled, members can be randomly rewarded for sending points to others. The amount rewarded and the chance of being rewarded can be configured (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Points options > Point transactions). Only non-anonymous transactions will qualify for this random lottery.

[title="3"]Points escrow[/title]

Members can also send each other points through the escrow system. This is commonly used when exchanging points with a written agreement, such as for a product or service.

To escrow points to another member, go to their points profile and click the &ldquo;Send via Escrow&rdquo; button. A form loads where you can specify the number of points to escrow, the reason (short and concise explanation of what is being exchanged with the points, such as the product or service), the expiration (deadline) if applicable, and the written agreement associated with the escrow. Only those with the &ldquo;Escrow points to others&rdquo; privilege can escrow points to others, which is enabled by default for all usergroups.

Once an escrow is created, the points will be deducted from the escrower's balance and held in the system. The other member will be notified that an escrow was created along with the written agreement. Once the agreement has been satisfied, both members must mark the escrow agreement as satisfied on the escrow screen. When that happens, the recipient member receives the escrowed points.

If an issue arises with the escrow, either member can dispute the escrow and provide a message explaining the dispute. When an escrow is disputed, those with the &ldquo;Moderate points escrowed&rdquo; privilege will be notified, and one of them can take an action. The action could be cancelling the escrow / returning the points back to the original member, marking the escrow as satisfied and giving all the points to the escrowed member, only crediting a partial amount of points to the recipient and returning the rest to the sender, or amending the text / agreement on the escrow. An escrow will also automatically be disputed by the system if only one member marked it as satisfied and the escrow expires.

Be aware that those with the &ldquo;Moderate points escrowed&rdquo; privilege cannot moderate escrows in which they are the sender or recipient; someone else with the privilege must resolve any disputes with that escrow.

If an escrow expires and neither member marked it as satisfied nor disputed, then the escrow is cancelled and the points returned to the original member.

Escrows can be viewed in a table on each member's points profile. Only those with the &ldquo;Moderate points escrowed&rdquo; privilege can see all escrows. Otherwise, members can only see escrows in which they were either the sender or recipient.
[/surround]

[title="2"]Viewing the points ledger[/title]

The full points ledger is accessible in the Admin Zone > Audit > Points ledger. There, you can see all of the points transactions that occurred on the website. Additionally, members can view each other's point transactions on their points profiles. Be aware that anonymous transactions will not show for members not involved in them (unless the member has the &ldquo;Trace the origin of anonymous point transactions&rdquo; privilege). Therefore, the total tally of a member's points received or sent may be higher than what the visible ledger sums to on a member's profile, but it will never be lower.

[title="2"]Modifying points[/title]

Those with the &ldquo;Moderate members' points&rdquo; privilege will see a &ldquo;Modify points&rdquo; box on member points profiles instead of &ldquo;Send points&rdquo;. This allows them to indirectly modify the points of others. A drop-down will be provided which allows, in addition to the sending of points, these actions:
 - [b]Credit[/b]: Credit (add) points to a member from the system. An example is to refund them for an outside purchase, or to reward them for something on behalf of the website.
 - [b]Debit[/b]: Debit (remove) points from a member to the system. An example is when a member makes a purchase outside of eCommerce and points escrow, or when they are being punished outside of a warning.

Crediting or debiting points, just like sending points, will create a new transaction visible in the ledger. It will also send a notification to the member (if they have the &ldquo;Your points transactions&rdquo; notification enabled).

[title="2"]Modifying point transactions[/title]

There are two permissible edit actions for point transactions: reversing a transaction, and amending the reason text.

When you [concept]reverse[/concept] a transaction, that involves creating a new transaction that offsets the original one. For example, Bob sends Sue 50 points in the form of 25 gift points and 25 regular points. When reversing this, a new transaction will be created where Sue sends back 50 regular points to Bob, and Bob receives them as 25 gift points and 25 regular points. The two transactions will also be linked together so the ledger displays that one reversed the other. Escrow cancellations and undoing warning charges work in the same way. To reverse a transaction, those with the &ldquo;Moderate members' points&rdquo; privilege can click the &ldquo;Undo&rdquo; icon in the actions column next to a point transaction either in the ledger or on a member's points profile. If you reverse a points transaction created from an escrow, the escrow will also automatically be cancelled.

The &ldquo;reason&rdquo; text for the ledger is the only thing that can be amended in a transaction. Those with the &ldquo;Amend reason on point transactions&rdquo; privilege can either use the Points ledger (Admin Zone > Audit > Points ledger) or the transactions on a member's points profile to amend the reason text.

[title="2"]Other economy tie-ins[/title]

[title="3"]Voting power in Topic Polls[/title]

Site administrators can enable the ability to weigh poll votes on Conversr Topic Polls based on the number of points a voter had at the time of voting. This means members with more points have a greater effect / voting power on a poll's results when they vote. 

This is covered more in-depth on the [page="_SEARCH:tut_forums"]Forums page[/page].

[title="3"]Buildr (non-bundled)[/title]

Buildr is a very large addon for Composr, made by the developers in a semi-official capacity. It is not included with the main release as it is totally inappropriate for non-community sites, and hence would be consider as 'bloat' (an excessive feature that gets in the way and causes undue complexity and confusion) by most.

Buildr is essentially a game, where members may move in, interact with, and create, a limitless world of rooms, split across multiple themed 'realms'. It can be used to create puzzles, adventures, board games, simulations, and with imagination, many other things.

Points are at the very core of Buildr, and are used in two ways:
1) It costs points (according to a configurable price) to add content to Buildr. Of course, members may try and redeem these points by asking members to send points back to them, but this feature prevents abuse and limits the need for moderation.
2) Members may add items to the system, and then sell these items to other members. An example of this being used, is for the controller of a realm used for a 'quest' to add a 'healthy' item into the system: those with more points have a higher chance of surviving to the end of the quest, as they can heal themselves.

The Buildr system is very simple, yet via the small set of options available, presents amazing possibilities.

[title="3"]Downloads[/title]

Members may submit downloads that cost points to download. Depending on how the submitter configures the download, these points may end up with that submitter, or thrown away.
This system allows:
 - staff to artificially limit access to ensure members participate before they can use site resources.
 - members to earn points to compensate themselves for the work contained within a download.

This is covered in the [page="_SEARCH:tut_adv_downloads"]Advanced provision of downloads[/page] tutorial.

[title="3"]The real world[/title]

A small number of sites may wish to set up a payment system (outside of the scope of Composr, at the time of writing), to allow members to exchange points for real money, or tangible products or services. Sites that may wish to do this are likely to be sites where the earning of points has a real effect on business goals, such that real-world reimbursement may be appropriate; for example, on a site where members collaborate on art for a published catalogue.

Alternatively, and perhaps more popularly, sites may allow members to exchange real money, for points (again, outside the scope of Composr, at the time of writing). Hence web-masters could earn money from their more enthusiastic members, and those members could elevate themselves on the website.

[title="2"]Rank in Conversr[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Rank ladder shown in the usergroup directory" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/rank.png[/media]
[media width="150" description="Rank configured when editing a usergroup" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/rank_options.png[/media]
[concept]Conversr[/concept] has a usergroup system that allows automated progression from one usergroup to another, according to point count. This is configured by default such that the usergroup rank images for the usergroups involved imply a rising rank.

The 'status symbol' of rank is an incentive for members to earn points (hence contributing to the site and community), but permissions may also be configured such as to give permission according to rank, simply by assigning the permissions differently for different usergroups.

If you would like to use rank, but not other point features, remove view permissions to the 'points' module and edit the 'Block options' (in the configuration) to not display point details. You cannot remove the points addon if you wish to use ranks.

Note that rank changes are triggered by actions. Someone will not go up in rank based on things like how long they've been a member, until some action (e.g. posting on the forum) triggers a rank recalculation.
[/surround]

[title="2"]The leader-board[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Options for a points leader-board" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_leader_board_config.png[/media]
[media width="150" description="The points leader-board" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_leader_board.png[/media]
The leader-board is a block, and corresponding archive viewing module, for the displaying of top point holders. Like rank, this is another incentive for members to earn points.

The module is the [tt]leader_board[/tt] module ([tt]site:leader_board[/tt] page-link, Social > Leader-board on the default menus).

You can create multiple different leader-boards with different options. Some of these options you can set include the following:
 - Number of members to rank on the leader-board
 - Time frame (weekly, monthly, or yearly)
 - Type of leader-board (rank according to total points, or rank according to points earned since the previous time frame)
 - Whether or not to include staff
 - Filter to one or more usergroups
 - The &ldquo;Cycle basis&rdquo;: whether generation is relative to when the leader-board was created or at the start of a time frame (e.g. start of the week / month / year)

Please be aware when you change the options of a leader-board, it only affects future results; it does not re-calculate past results.

The leader-board uses the system scheduler to generate its results. To generate a leader-board, Composr has to first go through all the members to calculate how many points they have. Points are calculated on-the-fly, and its intensive to do this for very large numbers of members. If you are concerned about the leader-board using a lot of server resources when it generates, you could consider limiting it to certain higher usergroups in a rank ladder. This way, effectively only members above a certain point threshold would be considered.
[/surround]

[title="2"]Tenets of the point system[/title]

The point system is designed to provide high levels of transparency, as a legitimate micro-economy. These strict tenets apply even for the highest privileged members.

[title="3"]Points are not directly edited[/title]

There are no convenient methods provided to directly edit members' point values. Changes go through the ledger.

[title="3"]Public ledger[/title]

Assuming members have the &ldquo;View full points ledger&rdquo; privilege (which they do by default), the ledger is publicly available. Senders are not visible for anonymous transactions, however, unless members have the &ldquo;Trace the origin of anonymous point transactions&rdquo; privilege.

[title="3"]Immutable ledger[/title]

The ledger serves as a transparent and honest record of every point transaction that took place on the website. And members should be able to trace every transaction that took place.

It is not possible to edit transactions, with the exception of the reason text. We carve out this exception because it is important to be able to moderate potentially dangerous or illegal content from any part of a website.

It is not possible to delete transactions.

Even the system maintains the immutability of the ledger.

[title="3"]Transactions cannot involve negative points[/title]

The system does not allow sending, crediting, debiting, nor charging (via warnings) negative points. Instead clear positive transactions must be added to the ledger.

[title="3"]Negative balances[/title]

Members can have a negative balance. Various things could put a member into this state (such as a manual debit of more from a member than they have, or changing the weights in the configuration that change their Life-time points value). Nothing the member can directly do themselves can lead to them having a negative balance, however.

Members cannot have negative points in their gift points balance (if gift points are enabled).

[title="2"]Points system implementation details (advanced)[/title]

[title="3"]Points are not stored in a single consistent tally[/title]

[media float="right" thumb="0" framed="0"]data_custom/images/docs/remember.png[/media]
The number of points a member has is not stored in any single consistent tally, so it is not directly editable as a single number. Instead, a member's points are dynamically calculated from multiple sources according to various weights. Editing a member's points should only be indirectly done by creating a new points transaction on a member's points profile.

There are two reasons points operate in this way:
1) To provide a transparent ledger.
2) Some sources of points are not held on the ledger, as they are accumulated from actions too far-flung and numerous to be held in live detail on the ledger.

Follows are some specific caveats:

[title="4"]Forum posts do not use point transactions[/title]

Be aware that posts, under the forum driver system, operate under case '2' as described above. Composr has no way of determining when a member makes a forum post (the forum does not tell Composr, as it is sometimes a third-party piece of software instead of Conversr). Therefore, the points earned from forum posts are calculated from a member's post count instead of using points transactions.

The main ramification of this is that if posts are deleted, the point count goes backwards for the members with deleted posts. And this cannot be traced in the points ledger (but the post deletion can be traced in the action logs). We consider this a feature (e.g. deleting spam automatically will reverse the point count, at least on robust forums where post count is automatically adjusted upon moderation). And our tenet is that the only reason for a post to be deleted is if it never should have existed to begin with. Deleting posts are the enemy of historical records. And the reasons for doing it are few because text generally takes up a trivial amount of space; databases are designed to deal with inconceivable amounts of data, and the topics can be just as easily closed or moved to a hidden archive forum if they are seen as 'getting in the way'.

[title="4"]Point balances may vary when configuration is changed[/title]

The number of points (and gift points if applicable) every member has in their balance is subject to change. It can vary when the site configuration is changed.

[title="3"]The points ledger is merely a log[/title]

The points ledger serves to keep track of how points were accumulated from explicit transactions. The ledger itself is only a log and not directly used to calculate how many points someone has in their balance. That is stored in dedicated custom profile fields that represent ongoing tallies of ledger activity (sending and receiving) and other activity that may modify a member's points balance.
