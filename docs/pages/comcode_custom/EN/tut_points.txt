There are many ways to earn points in Composr. You may not wish to tell your members the precise details for these, in order to avoid abuse and unbalanced member activity, although of course they could educate themselves by reading this tutorial.

Methods of earning points include:
 - Joining
 - Voting in a poll
 - Rating content
 - Poll chosen
 - Submitting various forms of content
 - Length of membership
 - Visiting the site
 - Posting on the forum
 - Entering/passing quizzes
 - Being given them (this is described in a later section)
 - Earning them from selling a download (this is described in a later section)

Most methods of earning points may be altered in the configuration (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Points options), so that the number of points earned from various activities is appropriate for your website.

There is a distinction between the point count for points available for spending, and the point count for the total points ever earned (which contributes to rank and leader-board position). This will usually be made clear, but sometimes circumstance will dictate what is the appropriate meaning.

[title="3"]A note about how points are calculated (somewhat advanced)[/title]

[media float="right" thumb="0" framed="0"]data_custom/images/docs/remember.png[/media]
The number of points a member has is not stored in any place, so is not directly editable. Instead, a members points is dynamically calculated, according to various statistics. You may alter the number of points a member has by viewing their points profile and using either the "give", "charge", or "refund" features (all of which accept negative values if you are a member of staff). For example, you could give positive points to a member as a reward, or you can give negative points to reverse a previous gift. You can "charge" points for a member's purchase or as discipline outside of the warnings system. And you can "refund" points that were previously charged.

The reason points are calculated in this way is that the forum driver system means that Composr has no way of determining when a member makes a forum post (the forum does not tell Composr, as it is often a third-party piece of software).

The main ramification of this is that if posts are deleted, the point count goes backwards for the members with deleted posts: we consider this a feature (deleting spam automatically will reverse the point count, at least on robust forums where post count is automatically adjusted upon moderation), and we consider it a bad idea to delete posts from a forum unless they should never have existed. We consider deleting posts the enemy of historical record and the reasons for doing it few, because text generally takes up a trivial amount of space, databases are designed to deal with inconceivable amounts of data, and the topics can be just as easily moved to a hidden archive forum if they are seen as 'getting in the way'.

[title="2"]Giving points[/title]

[media width="150" description="Those who give may get randomly rewarded by the system if gift points is enabled (this encourages an active community)" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_lucky.png[/media]
[concept]Point-giving[/concept] allows members to reward each other. Like money can be used to pay someone, so can points, based on whatever they value. This economical situation is very important, and essentially capitalism is embodied, such that people go hunting for work that is valued most highly in order to get high returns of points.

Reasons for giving points include:
 - Pseudo-payment for a service provided
 - A prize for winning a competition
 - A sign of appreciation for produce a high quality product that benefits the community

[title="3"]Gift points (advanced)[/title]

By default, members have a single point balance that they can use both to spend on things and to give to other members. However, website administrators who wish to separate points used for spending from points used for giving can use the "Enable gift points" configuration option (under Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Points options > Gift-point transactions).

[concept]Gift points[/concept] (when enabled) are a separate point balance. Members can only give other members points from their gift points balance but not their main points. Gift points are themselves not spendable until given. Gifted points are then spendable points to the receiving member. This may incentivise users to give more points more frequently.

For example, member A has 100 points and 25 gift points. Member A can spend their 100 points on purchases but cannot give any of those points to other members. Their 25 gift points cannot be spent on purchases but can be given to other members as gifts. If member A gives member B their 25 gift points, those points then become regular points for member B to spend.

[title="2"]Other economy tie-ins[/title]

[title="3"]Buildr (non-bundled)[/title]

Buildr is a very large addon for Composr, made by the developers in a semi-official capacity. It is not included with the main release as it is totally inappropriate for non-community sites, and hence would be consider as 'bloat' (an excessive feature that gets in the way and causes undue complexity and confusion) by most.

Buildr is essentially a game, where members may move in, interact with, and create, a limitless world of rooms, split across multiple themed 'realms'. It can be used to create puzzles, adventures, board games, simulations, and with imagination, many other things.

Points are at the very core of Buildr, and are used in two ways:
1) It costs points (according to a configurable price) to add content to Buildr. Of course, members may try and redeem these points by asking members to give points back to them, but this feature prevents abuse and limits the need for moderation.
2) Members may add items to the system, and then sell these items to other members. An example of this being used, is for the controller of a realm used for a 'quest' to add a 'healthy' item into the system: those with more points have a higher chance of surviving to the end of the quest, as they can heal themselves.

The Buildr system is very simple, yet via the small set of options available, presents amazing possibilities.

[title="3"]Downloads[/title]

Members may submit downloads that cost points to download. Depending on how the submitter configures the download, these points may end up with that submitter, or thrown away.
This system allows:
 - staff to artificially limited access, to ensure members participate before they can use site resources.
 - members to earn points to compensate themselves for the work contained within a download.

This is covered in the [page="_SEARCH:tut_adv_downloads"]Advanced provision of downloads[/page] tutorial.

[title="3"]The real world[/title]

A small number of sites may wish to set up a payment system (outside of the scope of Composr, at the time of writing), to allow members to exchange points for real money, or tangible products or services. Sites that may wish to do this are likely to be sites where the earning of points has a real effect on business goals, such that real-world reimbursement may be appropriate; for example, on a site where members collaborate on art for a published catalogue.

Alternatively, and perhaps more popularly, sites may allow members to exchange real money, for points (again, outside the scope of Composr, at the time of writing). Hence web-masters could earn money from their more enthusiastic members, and those members could elevate themselves on the website.

[title="2"]Rank in Conversr[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Rank ladder shown in the usergroup directory" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/rank.png[/media]
[media width="150" description="Rank configured when editing a usergroup" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/rank_options.png[/media]
[concept]Conversr[/concept] has a usergroup system that allows automated progression from one usergroup to another, according to point count. This is configured by default such that the usergroup rank images for the usergroups involved imply a rising rank.

The 'status symbol' of rank is an incentive for members to earn points (hence contributing to the site and community), but permissions may also be configured such as to give permission according to rank, simply by assigning the permissions differently for different usergroups.

If you would like to use rank, but not other point features, remove view permissions to the 'points' module and edit the 'Block options' (in the configuration) to not display point details. You cannot remove the points addon if you wish to use ranks.

Note that rank changes are triggered by actions. Someone will not go up in rank based on things like how long they've been a member, until some action (e.g. posting on the forum) triggers a rank recalculation.

[title="2"]The leader-board[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Options for a points leader-board" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_leader_board_config.png[/media]
[media width="150" description="The points leader-board" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_leader_board.png[/media]
The leader-board is a block, and corresponding archive viewing module, for the displaying of top point holders. Like rank, this is another incentive for members to earn points.

The module is the [tt]leader_board[/tt] module ([tt]site:leader_board[/tt] page-link, Social > Leader-board on the default menus).

You can create multiple different leader-boards with different options. Some of these options you can set include the following:
 - Number of members to rank on the leader-board
 - Time frame (weekly, monthly, or yearly)
 - Type of leader-board (rank according to total points, or rank according to points earned since the previous time frame)
 - Whether or not to include staff
 - Filter to one or more usergroups
 - The "Cycle basis": whether generation is relative to when the leader-board was created or at the start of a time frame (eg. start of the week / month / year)

Please be aware when you change the options of a leader-board, it only affects future results; it does not re-calculate past results.

The leader-board uses the system scheduler to generate its results. To generate a leader-board, Composr has to first go through all the members to calculate how many points they have. Points are calculated on-the-fly, and its intensive to do this for very large numbers of members. If you are concerned about the leader-board using a lot of server resources when it generates, you could consider limiting it to certain higher usergroups in a rank ladder. This way, effectively only members above a certain point threshold would be considered.
