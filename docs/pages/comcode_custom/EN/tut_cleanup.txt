The tools are divided into "De-cachers" and "Optimisers" (which don't all strictly involve optimising, some are for general other kinds of maintenance task).

For performance reasons, Composr defines a number of caches. During normal operation of Composr, these caches should be unnoticeable; if things are being edited from outside Composr theoretically Composr will automatically pick up on it, but you may sometimes need to force a cache flush.

On a default install all recommended caches are enabled, except when Composr is installed on [tt]localhost[/tt].

Some kinds of cache may be turned off in the configuration, but leaving them on gives vastly improved performance.

If you can identify a situation where you need to rebuild or empty a cache that should not exist, please report it as a bug.

There are a number of optimisers:
 - [b]Correct MySQL schema issues[/b] -- this is intended for programmers-only, you are very unlikely to need it.
 - [b]Optimise/fix database tables[/b] -- this will try and fix some database tables and works with MySQL-only. If the database has become very corrupt, you may need to use a tool such as phpMyAdmin to repair a database from outside Composr.
 - [b]Broken URLs[/b] -- this will look for broken URLs.
 - [b]Regenerate image thumbnails[/b] -- this will regenerate all thumbnails (slow and probably not useful).
 - [b]Find orphaned uploads[/b] -- find on-disk uploads that seem to no longer be referenced.
 - [b]Delete page access statistics[/b] -- remove old page statistics to reduce database usage.

Frankly most of these optimisers are not useful. We provide them for very rare situations, or for helping programmers manage complicated operations.
