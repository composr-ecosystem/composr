# Composr CMS Installation #

Basic instructions:
1) Download an official installation package (&dagger;) from the [official website](https://composr.app/download.htm)
2) Upload the contents to your server (extract directly on your server if you like)
3) Open the URL to the install.php in your web browser
4) Follow the instructions in the installer

&dagger; Developers may use a Git clone, but this is not to be used for release websites due to Git containing large numbers of non-bundled addons, including developer ones that may be actively dangerous.

For full instructions, view the [installation tutorial](https://composr.app/docs/tut_install.htm).
